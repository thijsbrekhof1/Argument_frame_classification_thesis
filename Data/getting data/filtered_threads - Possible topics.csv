97,CMV: Burritos are better than tacos.,"[{'body': ""I think your position is weak and too ethnocentric to actually mount a legitimate defense against critique. Firstly, [burritos are not actually from Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#History): they are an American take on a Mexican dish. The inauthenticity of the Burrito is insulting. The average burrito parlour is decorated in a way that tries to make it look Mexican, but this is the doing of conmen. I do not know about you, but I do not need to be lied to by burrito peddling capitalists to enjoy my food. This actually ruins some of the experience.\n\nDue to this unsightly Americanization burritos lose in one major area: Cost.\n\nFor the price of one burrito, I can get many tacos. A dollar just goes way further in the taco market than it does in the burrito market. Its inauthenticity is not only a major flaw, but also it's downfall.\n\nSo sure, if you're some pampered member of the bourgeoisie go ahead and eat your caviar Burritos.

According to the US Department of Transport, there are two kinds of acceptable ""bumping"" from overbooked flights: voluntary and involuntary.  Voluntary bumping is the most frequent type, and this is what you normally see when the airline offers you incentives to voluntarily take a later flight.  Carriers are given a lot of freedom in how they negotiate with passengers in order to get volunteers, but it is frequently in the carrier\'s interest to get volunteers.  This is due to the regulations around involuntary bumping.  \n\nInvoluntary bumping requires the airline to arrange alternative travel arrangements that get the customer to their intended destination within 1 hour of their original scheduled arrival time.  If the customer arrives between 1 and 2 hours late, the carrier is forced to pay significant penalties to the customer for the inconvenience.  Any more than 2 hours incurs a 400% penalty that the carrier must pay to the customer.  This is all to protect the customer from overzealous overbooking.  The official rules are a bit more nuanced than my synopsis, and you can read them in their entirety here: https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights\n\nSo while overbooking can be problematic, I don\'t think it should necessarily be illegal.

It\'s a mundane fact that a fetus is just a human at the fetal stage of life, just like a corpse is human at the ""dead"" stage. Personhood is pointed to as a morally significant category, in contrast to the less significant category of ""human"", because persons are the principal objects of moral focus. Breaking a rock doesn\'t matter much unless it matters to people, and breaking a person in half matters precisely because it\'s a person we\'re breaking in half.\n\nI\'m pro-choice myself but I think the move away from ""personhood"" ignores a central concern. What\'s more crucial is whether a fetus\'s personhood (or lack thereof) matters *enough* to outweigh the other interests at stake. If a fetus isn\'t a person then it\'s not much of an issue. If it is a person then we\'ve got to weigh the value of that fact against the other concerns in the situation.

Supply siders are often- not by coincidence- lifelong conservatives who hold conservative values. It is important to have a knowledge of economics in order to determine what the data says rather than what people\'s opinions are. For example, if you learn that trickle down economics is not based in fact, you can form an opinion on what the marginal tax rate should be based on your values, rather than based on the idea that a lower marginal rate will help the poor. \n\n3.

Christians see nothing wrong with the second because it\'s not involving the church. Why gays want to involve the church all the time I don\'t know. But they\'re basically forcing the church to do something blasphemous in the eyes of God so they feel better about themselves. It\'s totally symbolic. The civil union is all that matters in a governmental way. Married vs civil union for the most part is exactly the same.

Modern dogs have evolved alongside humans to perform all kinds of different tasks; we have bred them to hunt, herd, and guard for us.  We have even bred them for purely aesthetic purposes, i.e. ""cute,"" ""tall,"" ""short,"" etc.\n\nIn the west, this utilitarian view of dogs is pervasive and is akin to horses (which are also not seen as a source of food).

The reason I don\'t believe this will happen (at least not in the near future-- the introduction of advanced deep learning tech will almost certainly produce information that is beyond the grasp of human knowledge today.) is because once we discover something, teaching that thing is almost infinitely easier than the time it took to discover that thing. Computers are a great example-- they took almost a century from the prototypical idea of a computer to a computer that would be somewhat recognizable today, and have accelerated greatly over the past 3 decades. However, if you\'re a computer scientist, you probably spend at most a few classes learning all of that information throughout your academic life. \n\nCalculus is the same way.

Every election cycle in the US, all we hear is how we\'re sick of ""DC insiders"" and ""career politicians"".  People complain that candidates say whatever it takes to get elected.  For better or worse, Trump cannot be accused of that.  This is a guy who is running for him, not for any special interests.  Not for any companies.  He says exactly what he means, however crazy it is.  \n\nBelieve it or not, people see that as refreshing.  They figure that ALL politicians think crazy things, but at least this one is honest about it.  They figure they at least know what they\'re getting, and he\'s saying a lot of the things they think other politicians are afraid to say.  \n\nSecondly, Sanders:\n\nI do not like Bernie Sanders.  I think his mentality is incredibly divisive, and I won\'t support that in any politician, no matter whether or not I agree with their policies.  Regardless of his solutions, which have been pretty sparse and, in my opinion, short-sighted, his platform is very much ""It\'s the fault of rich people and businesses"", and I don\'t like that.

One-third of the time they were asked to fill it out as they think a âtypical liberalâ would respond. One-third of the time they were asked to fill it out as a âtypical conservativeâ would respond. This design allowed us to examine the stereotypes that each side held about the other. More important, it allowed us to assess how accurate they were by comparing peopleâs expectations about âtypicalâ partisans to the actual responses from partisans on the left and the right)â Who was best able to pretend to be the other?\n&gt; \n&gt; The results were clear and consistent. Moderates and conservatives were most accurate in their predictions, whether they were pretending to be liberals or conservatives.

For example, 50% of Republican voters said that the Republicans had a better chance of winning the presidency if someone other than Trump were the nominee (46% said he gave a better chance). If you look at the [most recent Quinnipiac poll](http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/us/us12222015_Uhkm63g.pdf), you'll see that while Trump is leading 28% (4 points above Cruz), 28% of Republican respondents also said that they would *not* support Trump.

Personally, I think at this point that Trump is perhaps *likely* to win the nomination, but it\'s not entirely uncommon for frontrunners to get dislodged at this point in the cycle. The most famous example - and the one that offers perhaps the best parallel - is 2004, where Howard Dean emerged as an ""outsider"" in the race and was consider a clear frontrunner heading into the Iowa primary.  Of course, Dean\'s lead wasn\'t nearly as commanding as Trump, but he was ahead by double digits in the national polls at this point in the [process](http://www.pollster.com/blogs/primaries_past.html). Of course, he went on to resoundingly lose in Iowa, and he made some tactical errors afterwards that made it impossible for him to recover. Particularly if Trump loses Iowa, I would say he also is quite capable of saying something stupid that might tank his support among voters.  \n\nMy main reason for skepticism is that Trump is resoundingly hated by the establishment. Historically, candidates who don\'t have the support of their party\'s leaders don\'t win the nomination.

Remember that people fled Europe to come settle the new world because religion was being forced on them.  When they set up a government that separated church from state people started going back to religion exactly because they were free to do as they chose to.  What do you think happens when people are told they can no longer practice as they see fit (which includes indoctrinating their children).  People are oppositional by nature.  Telling people there is something they can't have or must have will only cause the opposite to surge in popularity.  England still has the Church of England to this day and it is one of the least religious places in the world.  India and the USA are two of the most legally secular places in the world and they are both steeped in wide spread religion.  \n\nI think /u/doctorcynicism has it right.

LGBT Native Americans wanting to be identified within their respective tribes and not grouped with other races officially adopted the term âTwo Spiritâ from the Ojibwe language in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 1989.

22,CMV: Women who fear random men are being sexist and propagating illogical fear,"[{'body': ""Oneof the most important lessons I've learned, as a man, is to view things from a woman's perspective.\n\nLet's say you're just minding your business, walking home late on a Saturday night, and a group of four women call out to you with various compliments. 'I like your legs!' 'Looking good, hot stuff!'. If you are like most straight men I know, this encounter--assuming you didn't pursue their advances--would be an ego boost, and that's where it ends. If the group persists beyond that...well, what can they really do if you rebuff their advances? I've literally never heard of a case where three women forcibly hold a man down while a fourth rapes them.\n\nNow imagine the opposite situation. You're a woman walking home late at night, and a group of four males catcalls at you. You are FULLY AWARE that, most likely, even one of them could overpower you if push comes to shove. Even if the group of men's intent is wholly innocent--just trying to holla at an attractive girl--there is a threatening aspect because you know they could overpower you. There is a danger that exists in one scenario that is more realistic than the other.\n\nThis is a situation that, as a male, I will never experience. I'm not the most proficient fighter n the world, but if it's a situation where it's me versus 2-3 average girls, I'm not super concerned. If I'm a woman versus 1-2 average males, the calculus completely changes.

Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance or undue intrusiveness. \n\nâ Show compassion for those who may be affected by news coverage. Use heightened sensitivity when dealing with juveniles, victims of sex crimes, and sources or subjects who are inexperienced or unable to give consent. Consider cultural differences in approach and treatment. \n\nâ Recognize that legal access to information differs from an ethical justification to publish or broadcast. \n\nâ Realize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than public figures and others who seek power, influence or attention. Weigh the consequences of publishing or broadcasting personal information. \n\nâ Avoid pandering to lurid curiosity, even if others do. \n\nâ Balance a suspectâs right to a fair trial with the publicâs right to know. Consider the implications of identifying criminal suspects before they face legal charges. \n\nâ Consider the long-term implications of the extended reach and permanence of publication.
