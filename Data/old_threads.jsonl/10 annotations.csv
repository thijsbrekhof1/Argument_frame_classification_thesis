It\'s small and very overcrowded. The Yonge–University is the 2nd most crowded subway line in North America. The words ""downtown relief line"" have been uttered by Torontonians for decades now, and nothing has been done about it. Light rail was cancelled by Rob Ford and has been delayed until the 2020\'s. Public transit expansion simply doesn\'t match up for Toronto\'s population growth. A 8.6km 6 station extension of the Younge-University line will cost 2.6 billion. And that\'s the only expansion the subway has seen since the pathetic Shepard line in 2002 which only sees a ridership of 50k per day. \n\nTraffic.

And the 401 is the only major public highway that goes through Toronto. Thus it\'s the busiest highway in North America. It\'s constantly congested. The average Torontonian will [spend 84 hours a year](http://www.cp24.com/news/average-commuter-spent-84-hours-stuck-in-toronto-traffic-in-2014-study-1.230535) stuck in Traffic. It\'s ruins your life. You have to leave home at 7am and you\'ll only get home at 7pm. Do you want to spend your day in traffic? No, but in Toronto you have no other choice, I already covered how much public transit is underfunded. \n\nWeather. Toronto has hot as shit summers and cold as shit winters.

There's tons of stuff to do there, it's very vibrant, it's booming, and for a city of its size, it's actually very affordable to live in.

It's like what Portland wants to be, but 5 times the size. The only issue I have with Toronto is the people are not particularly friendly, but the same could be said of almost any city.

The food is excellent as well, and I love the waterfront and all the parks. Even though it's a huge city, you never feel that far away from nature.

It's also in Canada, which is my favorite country in the world. Does anyone want to try to change my mind and suggest a better city on this continent?

The class is constantly being slowed down for people who have a hard time understanding the subject. Also, in a class with 20+ people, the teacher won't be able to cater to everyone's learning style.

We do not have honors classes, though there are tracks that are considered more advanced (Intro to Analysis vs Calc in Junior).Experiences could differ on average, public v private, by state, or many other measures. \n\nThis year (Junior) I took two A.P. Classes, which you also took!: U.S. History and English Language and Composition. I\'m going to outline my experiences in both, and my previous A.P. Euro class (bundling it with U.S.), then directly respond to your post (feel free to skip to that, though I will reference the classes in it).\n\n* U.S./Euro History: I personally enjoyed both of these classes very much; however, there is likely a slight bias as I enjoy history very much. Both of these classes *did* feel as though they were rushing to cover all content before the deadline (the A.P. Test). As a result, the class was primarily lecture oriented. This is not my favorite formula for a class; however, there were several mitigating factors. In both classes, it was *heavily* emphasized that we should be focusing on the broader picture, not the details. In addition, both teachers were extremely knowledgeable about the subject (this could just be all AP teachers, but both graded A.P. Tests. My U.S. Teacher was also involved in creating the test for many years before she quit that). On a little more minor note, they both provided the notes online which was awesome :D. That pretty much sums them up; heavily lecture oriented and content focused, but still very interesting and well done. I should also mention that there was a good amount of detail on tests, but the level of memorization was not obscene. As an example, we\'d need to list the order of events leading up the American Revolution, but not the exact dates of any of them.\n* A.P. Lang: By far my favorite (serious) class in High School so far, A.P. Lang was radically different than either history class. In the class, there was very little focus on, well, learning about language and composition haha. To clarify, she structured the class around a variety of Units in which we would read and analyze pieces of writings and other mediums arguing two sides of a modern issue (race, gender, the influence of technology, etc). We would then have either whole-class or smaller group discussion and debate about the issue. During these, she would take a mainly hands-off approach except to try to make sure everyone got a voice. Finally, we were assigned a ""summative unit assessment"" in which we would write, generally, a paper of our own arguing our own position on the issue. She would try to encourage variety by making emphasizing certain styles or techniques of delivery though. I.E. we had to deliver a pecha kucha on whatever issue we wanted- 2 minutes of memorized talking while a slideshow rolls behind you. We would also periodically have separate papers that would be on the A.P. Test such as Rhetorical Analysis and that paper where you are given sources to use :P. Long story short; awesome teacher who incorporated feedback, encouraged open-mindedness, and the course did not feel rushed to cover content at all.  \n\nFinally, time for my actual response :P. There are very clearly A.P. classes which have a heavy focus on content, and the A.P. test sets a hard limit in which they must fit that content in. This can limit creative teaching styles. However, in my experience (no studies on this, sorry D:), the courses in which this is true behave similarly outside of A.P. All of my histories have been the same style; they simply had less stress to fit everything in. In contrast, my A.P. Lang class was far better than the other English classes I\'ve had so far, though I loved those as well. Thus, my argument is that, while A.P. Classes can add greater pressure, the experience is still completely dependent on the teacher. If you have teachers who are not passionate about the subject (all of mine really were), as you indicated yours weren\'t, than the class will likely be lackluster, regardless of level. One thing that I\'ve noticed is that there is always room to be creative while teaching a subject. My U.S. Teacher would take large amounts of time for us to discuss politics in the U.S. today. She would also take the opportunity to draw connections between the subject and our world today. To me, this made the information that we were learning feel more important and relevant; she could have also taken that time to experiment with different teaching styles. A poor teacher will easily take the deadline as an excuse not to experiment, but that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be done. \n\nTLDR: A.P.\'s can place greater pressure on teachers to cover content, but in the end the quality of the course is just as dependent on the teacher as any other class.\n\nSorry for the monster post xD.\n\nEDIT: Someone is going to be tempted to say DBQ where I said ""that paper where you are given sources to use"", but she was very clear that we were not supposed to consider them the same :P', 'ups': 1, 'author': 'SoMuchForSubtleties', 'controversiality': 0, 'link_id': 't3_4pohua', 'subreddit': 'changemyview', 'level': 0, 'score': 1, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2w2s8', 'author_flair_text': None, 'edited': False, 'id': 'd4n81s0', 'urls': [], 'children': [], 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'created_utc': 1466831687}, {'distinguished': None, 'retrieved_on': 1469272743, 'stickied': False, 'gilded': 0, 'parent_id': 't3_4pohua', 'body': ""From my personal experience (I took 5 AP's), most of my teachers treated them with a focus on the fact that they were the highest level classes in their respective subjects.

I concur with a number of the other comments here that the issue may be with the teacher or the school, as I can say that from my own experience all those years ago I had a number of excellent teachers for my AP classes (even U.S. History) that made the courses fun and engaging.

Your response to this is the honors level class.

The threshold for entering these classes was made low, and the same systemic issues emerged in these setting as at the standard level.\nAP classes are able to give an extra level of stratification on top of the honors system, where the teachers were able to tailor their teaching and lesson plan styles much more narrowly to distribution of students in the classroom', 'ups': 1, 'author': 'ironfishie', 'controversiality': 0, 'link_id': 't3_4pohua', 'subreddit': 'changemyview', 'level': 0, 'score': 1, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2w2s8', 'author_flair_text': None, 'edited': False, 'id': 'd4nnlsc', 'urls': [], 'children': [], 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'created_utc': 1466873226}, {'distinguished': None, 'retrieved_on': 1469272452, 'stickied': False, 'gilded': 0, 'parent_id': 't3_4pohua', 'body': ""What you can get out of an AP class isn't just limited to what CollegeBoard crams into that particular year.

In my experience, the volume of information taught in AP classes is undermined by what a passionless trek the curriculum is. Each of these courses had a very strict curriculum involving large amounts of rote memorization, along with rehearsing the same long answer techniques and structures over and over. I think this makes students less invested in the subject and more likely to forget everything they learned the second the test is over.

Compare this to an Honors or a CP (standard-level) course, where teachers are able to design lessons to fit the needs of their class. They can assign projects that relate to student interests and conduct lessons in a way that makes them passionate, which can contribute to an effective learning environment. Getting students invested can make them more likely to be invested in later classes in related subjects, or even to pursue a career in that field. 

The flexibility also allows teachers to cater to different learning styles and performance levels. Even at an AP level, people learn differently. Students would be much more engaged with the lessons - much more likely to learn - if their individual needs were met.

Personally, I think I learned more in standard level classes. I can still remember individual lessons and interesting projects, and I can apply that knowledge to my life. Reading it out of an Amsco textbook just doesn't cut it, for me and for a lot of people I've spoken to.

Hopefully somebody here can convince me I didn't just waste a year of my life. Other than college credit, what is the value of taking AP courses?

Because you are depressed, you see things from the perspsctive of a depressed person. I realize this seems obvious, but it\'s one of those things that is easy to overlook when in the middle of something. If you don\'t recognize that and say ""Oh, my current mindset is probably altering my perception of that view point to make it fit with my concept, I should probably step back and try to objectively evaluate it."" it becomes easy to convince yourself that everything supports it.\n\nThat said, there is a concept in Psychology known as ""Schema."" to simplify it a bit, schema are our psychological building blocks, or our foundation. It\'s often described in the analogy of a house. No matter how pretty you make the walls and decor of the house (Weight or personal image, job, relationships, etc etc), if you built it on a cracked foundation, you haven\'t really addressed the actual issue.\n\nSomewhere along the way, something impacted your Schema in a negative capacity. You need to get to that root cause and fix the foundation itself.

There is a reason there is very little research done into existential depression--it\'s because it doesn\'t necessarily lead to life dysfunction. People can be cynical and vaguely disturbed by the meaninglessness of life and still brush their teeth, pay their bills, go to work, fornicate, have a social life/family, and enjoy a movie or a book. Untreated, major clinical depression is more like, ""I have arrived at the point where showering is too overwhelming a task and I haven\'t checked my mail in 6 weeks or spoken out loud to another human being since last Tuesday. And I don\'t care.""\n\nThere is, as far as I know, no established treatment for existential depression. All I know is what worked for me, which was studying Buddhism. As an atheist, I was surprised that any level of spirituality could ever be a factor in my life, but I find that my atheism is no obstacle to my interest in Buddhism, which is focused on mindfulness and experience, not divine, magical rewards in an unknowable afterlife. I don\'t even necessarily accept spiritual rebirth as it is related to Buddhism (though I do accept it on the ""the atoms in my body are stardust and will be returned to the worms when I die"" level).\n\nI am not a very good Buddhist. My practice is haphazard and I can only read translations of things and works written in English by Buddhist teachers. But the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path directly line up with my experience of the world, and my sad attempts at practice have made a difference in my life. The closest thing I have encountered in therapy to Buddhist teachings is cognitive behavioral therapy, specifically dialectical behavioral therapy, which is very focused on mindfulness and living ""in the moment"" and not in the past or future.

Depending on the type of narcissist, they could choose someone equally as abusive because they believe their child is worthless trash and deserves to be abused, or choose someone that blindly follows said parent so they could maintain control over their child. \n\n', 'ups': 3, 'author': 'peskymuggles', 'controversiality': 0, 'link_id': 't3_1zr8jr', 'subreddit': 'changemyview', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2w2s8', 'removal_reason': None, 'downs': 0, 'children': [], 'score': 3, 'retrieved_on': 1432690279, 'archived': True, 'created_utc': '1394148998', 'score_hidden': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'edited': False, 'id': 'cfw9df6', 'name': 't1_cfw9df6', 'urls': [], 'author_flair_css_class': None}, {'distinguished': None, 'level': 0, 'gilded': 0, 'parent_id': 't3_1zr8jr', 'body': 'I guess it really depends on what you mean by ""social progress.""

If marriage is perceived as necessary and desirable by a society (such as in India), then it is more likely that those who choose not to marry will be at a disadvantage.

One family would essentially sell their daughter to another for political or economic reasons. Sometimes, they might have done it to improve their social standing. But it wasn't something that a man and woman did for love. They may have learned to love each other later, but they didn't love each other when they married.  

Fortunately, we no longer approve of the dowry system. And people seem to believe that marrying for love is better than arranged marriages - that it's a sign of progress. I disagree.  

While I certainly don't think it's right to see or treat your child, especially your daughter, as a piece of property to be sold or traded for political, economic, or social reasons, I do think that children owe something to their parents. Your parents brought you into this world. Ideally, they clothed you, fed you, paid for your education, taught you the right things, loved you, and sheltered you.

They've given so much to you - again, ideally - I think it's only fair to give them something back.  

Besides, arranged marriages aren't formed by two people lost in emotion. When people marry for love, like in the west, they tend to see each other through rose-colored glasses. They don't see each other realistically and they idealize each other. They get married in a rush and then, later on, find out that they're incompatible and end up getting divorced. By contrast, arranged marriages are set up by two people who aren't lost in emotion but are genuinely looking out for their children's best interests. They look at more important things like financial stability and education background. It's kind of like when a kid wants to eat only pizza and ice cream but his/her parents give the kid healthy nutritious food instead.  

The statistics bear me out, as well. Generally speaking, arranged marriages tend to have lower divorce rates (less than 2% in India, I think), and lower rates of infidelity and abuse. Meanwhile, half of marriages formed on the basis of love (especially in the US) end in divorce and infidelity and abuse run rampant in the west.  

We tend to think that acceptance marrying for love is a sign of progress. But I don't think it is. I think it's a fundamental breakdown of the family.",25,I believe the concept of marrying for love is not a sign of social progress.

I stopped playing before Pandaria was finished, and while I've read up on some of the lore, I don't follow it nearly as in depth.\n\nSo, Wrathgate. A brief refresher if you missed it: some rogue elements within the Forsaken, lead by a dreadlord named Varimathras. At wrathgate, these rogue elements of the Forsaken release a new plague that kills everyone- horde and alliance alike. Obviously not good.\n\nThe results are what's important though: both the Horde, and Alliance attack and assault the Undercity. Varian does not wait to let the Horde handle their affairs, he intervenes just as quickly as Thrall and Co. are able to, if not faster.\n\nAnd currently he's based out of Stormwind during this ordeal.\n\nIt's here that Varian declares war on the Horde, calling the [orcs green-skinned abominations](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Quest:The_Battle_For_The_Undercity_(Alliance\\)).

Stormwind is on the other half of the continent, and still the Forsaken have felt, more clearly than any other faction in WoW, how vulnerable they are. And, at least before the end of MoP, the Forsaken were seen as monsters even within the Horde- let alone the Alliance. \n\nDoes that make it right that the Forsaken invaded Gilneas? No. But to the Forsaken, they're in a battle for their very survival as a race, not for the continued political existence of an organization. The Alliance could rise or fall- or even the Horde.

When I played, I was exclusively a Horde player, so that is the only side I ever saw the conflict from.\n\nThe Forsaken are the ones with the clearest reason for their feelings towards the Alliance.  When they broke free of the Scourge, the humans at the time saw them as no different and treated them the same as the servants of the Lich King.  The Forsaken then had to defend themselves against attacks by the Alliance.  The whole reason they join the Horde in the first place was to get aid against the humans.  This sort of treatment breeds deep grudges. Sylvanas in particular was a person dedicated to the defense of her people in life and is now equally as zealous about defending her new people in death.  That means she is willing to be quite aggressive about making sure the needs of the Forsaken are met.\n\nThe Blood Elves are in a bit of a different position.  They are open to the idea of peace, but there is a still a bit of resentment floating around.  It might not be clear if you have just played the MMO, but the Blood Elves used to be a part of the Alliance.  During their time in the Alliance, they were the wise old race with a lot of power that helped out the less powerful races.  However, when the Sunwell was destroyed they lost a great deal of their power.  At the time when they finally needed help from the Alliance more than they could give, the human kingdoms abandoned them and left them to tend to their problems by themselves.  As such, the Blood Elves have a bit of a feeling of ""fuck you very much"" towards their old allies.\n\nWith the Orcs their are two main groups.  The first is the racist agenda spearheaded by Garrosh.  It is important to note that he caused just as much problems for other races in the Horde as he did for the Alliance.  The opinion of him and his followers was that the Horde was for Orcs only and they attempted to kick out the other races.  However, this movement was opposed by the bulk of the Horde including a large number of Orcs.  But, the Alliance didn\'t see most of the internal struggles and reacted to the actions of Garrosh\'s faction as if they were the actions of the entire Horde.  Imagine if Trump were to decide to bomb Toronto.  It might not be representative of the feeling that most American\'s have,m but because he is the leader of the US the world would react to such an action as if it was America as a whole that did it.  This is exactly what happened when Garrosh bombed Theramore.  Some members of the Horde were against it, but the Warchief gave his orders so it happened.  I should also point out that this disagreement was enough to cause a Civil War in the Horde which deposed Garrosh.  Enough members of the Horde opposed what he was doing enough to fight against him and win, but all the Alliance saw was the Horde acting a fool and then switching leaders.\n\nThe other source of problems with Orcs is good old fashion border disputes.  Similar to what happens in real life, there are several places where various Orc clans have made claims to territory that races in the Alliances have also made claims to.  These places produce a number of skirmishes all of the time and further entrench old grudges.  Just like how in real life, Israel and Palestine can\'t decide who own\'s Jerusalem, the Warsong Outriders and the Silverwing Sentinels can\'t decide who owns Warsong Gulch.  I should point out that in fights like these, they can drag on for long enough that the people who started the fight are long dead by the time the fight ends.  Eventually, no one remembers why they are fighting just that they hate the other guy.  Orcs and Humans have been fighting like this for decades and in a fight like that, a lull of a couple of years doesn\'t really change much.\n\nI should also point out that just like the Orcs have old grudges against the humans that date back to WC2, the Draenei have old grudges against the Orcs that date back to the same time period.  The Orcs of the Horde haven\'t done much to them directly recently, but the Draenei have not forgotten how they were treated by Orcs in Outland and the feelings that remain make peace difficult.\n\nThe rest of the Horde factions don\'t really have any direct issues with the Alliance.  But since they joined the Horde for other reasons they stand by their allies faithfully.  The Trolls and the Tauren joined the Horde to get the resources and power they needed to fight local enemies that threatened them (murlocs and centaurs respectively).  The Goblins joined because their home straight up got destroyed by Deathwing so they needed a new place to live and Thrall said ""you can crash at my place"".  Once they joined they Horde, they were not going to turn their new friends when they need help.  The Orcs helped the Trolls fight the Sea-Witch so the Trolls will help the Orcs fight the humans.', 'author': 'Crayshack', 'controversiality': 0, 'link_id': 't3_5p3ev8', 'subreddit': 'changemyview', 'level': 0, 'score': 2, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2w2s8', 'author_flair_text': '82∆', 'edited': False, 'id': 'dco745x', 'urls': [], 'children': [{'distinguished': None, 'retrieved_on': 1486208762, 'stickied': False, 'gilded': 0, 'parent_id': 't1_dco745x', 'body': 'Incredibly in depth lore analysis!

That does sometimes mean making emotional decisions rather than rational ones, but you get that regardless.\n\nAs far as failing to make peace when the opportunity is presented, you see a similar situation many times in real world history.  Once you have enough grudges built up, every little thing is taken as an offense.  There are many borders on Earth that are one diplomatic faux pas away from a full out war.  You see it happen many times in Warcraft from both sides.  \n\nA relatively recent example comes at the start of the Legion expansion.  The Alliance and the Horde are coordinating on a military action against the Burring Legion together.  From the Alliance perspective, it looks like the battle is going well and is almost won when the Horde unexpectedly sounds the retreat and leaves the Alliance exposed.  This is taken as an act of betrayal by the Alliance leaders at the battle.  However, from the Horde perspective they are getting battered and are barely holding their ground.  Many of their leaders are gravely wounded and the Warchief himself is down for the count.  In an effort to save what wounded they can and regroup to fight another day, Sylvanas orders a full retreat.\n\nFrom a Horde perspective, this is a reasonable action and it is hard to see how they did anything wrong.  However, if all I had seen was the Alliance perspective, then it would make sense to count it as evidence that the Horde cannot be trusted.  If they had a long history of friendly relations, an event like this could easily have been forgiven and forgotten, but with the bad blood they have built up over many years something like this can drive a wedge through the middle of any progress they have made.\n\nI don't actually know anything about Sylvanas making any deals with Odyn.

ESPECIALLY THE FORSAKEN. As a Worgen main, I was miffed when they attacked Gilneas seemingly exclusively because they wanted more of the Eastern Kingdoms and that they hate the Humans for shunning them and their rotting corpse bodies (or something, I just hate the undead).

Change my view of the Horde. Has the Alliance done anything truly wrong or devious to the Horde? Is Sylvanas and her Forsaken correct in their hatred?

I believe Truman Capote had some issues with finishing In Cold Blood on time–at the least, anyone who published serially (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Charles Dickens) had to work to a deadline, and would have to finish their book as fast as possible.\n\n&gt;every writer gets writers block, and rushing them would only decline the quality of the work.\n\nI think it's odd that writing is the one profession that we accept having a 'block' in. I've never heard of 'architect's block', for instance. But when you're a professionally paid writer, you are being paid to produce work. You are not being paid to sit around with several martinis waiting for 'inspiration', because, as someone who writes creatively a fair deal themselves, sometimes you really need to be rushed to finish that first draft. \n\n&gt;it is their project, being the author. Not ours. They should have the freedom to take as long as they want.\n\nTo a certain extent that's true. But to another extent, they are getting paid to work to a deadline. If you have a book deal, you're being paid to work to that deadline. \n\nLet's put it this way: You wouldn't excuse a TV series for being two years late with its second season because the writers of it had writer's block and needed to take their time. You wouldn't excuse a movie for coming out three months after its scheduled release date because of rewrites–I know this often happens with movies, and it's never excused. When writers are being paid, it stops being 'their project'. It is now the project of the person paying them. A first novel is exclusively the writer's project–they aren't being paid to write it, it can take as long as they want. But the second they want to turn it into a series, and they're paid in advance for each book in that series, it is not their personal project anymore.

For that to happen, my publishers told me, they would need the completed manuscript before the end of October. That seemed very do-able to me... in May. So there was the first deadline: Halloween.\n\n&gt; Around about August, I had to face facts: I was not going to be done by Halloween. \n\n&gt;I took advantage of the visit to have another sit down with my editors and publishers and told them that I didn't think I could deliver by Halloween. I thought they'd be sick about it... but I have to say, my editors and publishers are great, and they took it with surprising equanimity. (Maybe they knew it before I did). They already had contigencies in place. They had made plans to speed up production. If I could deliver WINDS OF WINTER by the end of the year, they told me, they could still get it our before the end of March. \n\n&gt;Here it is, the first of January. The book is not done, not delivered. No words can change that. I tried, I promise you. I failed.

I was trying to unpack exactly what that means and had a few thoughts:      \n\nConfrontation like this is obviously futile in trying to change the minds of the other side. That is, very few of the alt-right attendees walked away embracing diversity and liberal ideas. I feel safe in claiming this. I don\'t think confrontation like this is the way to change peoples minds, whether it be about religion, Islamic terrorism, or whatever. I think actually the exact opposite is what\'s required... try as hard as you can to empathize with them, understand them, and then once you understand them better see if there is any leverage for persuasion.           \n\nSo, if it\'s not the members of the alt-right themselves that were to be persuaded, who is the message of ""intolerance"" meant to be aimed at? While the left is supposedly denouncing ""ideas"" I bet the way most people feel about this issue is based more on identity and cultural affiliation. The tactics of the left and the right in Cville is going to push those people still ""undecided"" about their ""identity"" one way or another. I don\'t think it\'s entirely clear how the numbers will shake out, but, as others have pointed out, a lot of attention has now been given to groups that people probably wouldn\'t even have known about. Further, ironically, the alt-right will now probably claim that they are the ""oppressed"" group, and this offers a certain appeal to those who consider themselves outsiders and disaffected.          \n\nAs for pushing these views underground, I\'m not entirely sure that\'s desirable either. Does that normally work? Did it work with the protestants in France? Does it work with radical Islamists?

Because no one really remembers what the protest was for.  The tuba player stole their thunder.\n\nThe reason why no counter-protest is a *bad* idea is because our actions are in part governed by the principle of social proof.  In a nutshell, when we witness something novel (in this case white-supremacist marches) we look around to see how others are reacting to it.  If everyone else is ignoring it, we\'ll not only ignore it, but we\'re likely to think *everyone thinks it\'s OK*.  And that\'s not OK!  In it\'s most extreme forms this can manifest itself in disasters like the Jim Jones People\'s Temple suicides, or as in the murder of a neighbor without anyone so much as lifting a finger to call the police (you\'ve probably heard of this as the ""bystander effect"" originally from the story about the murder of Kitty Genovese which lasted half an hour, and was witnessed by more than 30 people, but *not one of them* even called the police).  If the media covers these protests (and they always do) and we see NO ONE counter-protesting, pretty soon people will start to think that everyone else thinks it\'s OK, or that they\'re even giving tacit support.

Giving them that kind of attention is exactly what they what they were hoping for. Whether or not people want to acknowledge it, the events that transpired this weekend were a huge victory for their cause, because any publicity = good publicity. 

In the same vein as the Westboro Baptist Church, they were almost certainly hoping some of the counter-protesters would instigate violence so they could say ""You see? We're not the violent ones!"" and add legitimacy to their cause. You could say that the kid who ran over all those people delegitimizes that argument, but a) it became a national story where again, any publicity = good publicity and b) people like Richard Spencer are already spinning it as a [""he was instigated"" or ""acting in self defense"" situation](https://twitter.com/LucidHurricaneX/status/896845295186825216) which is all the convincing some people need who were already leaning that way. 

Counter-protesting in this circumstance served no purpose. Both sides obviously have very strong convictions about their respective world views. None of the counter-protesters went there with the intent to change anybody's mind. Hurling insults and throwing bricks/punches didn't help, it made them look gullible and stupid. 

They should have let them have their sad little tiki torch rally all by themselves, if nobody showed up to counter protest it would've come off as comical.

All organic substances are either secreted by cells or cells themselves. A significant amount of computer hardware is not transistor based, and there really is no fundamental unit.\n\nI will ignore the point about cells only being created by cells. We take it as a premise that machines are created by organics, and to stanch the discussion by asserting that only things which are not created can be alive is to dismiss the issue altogether. The issue at hand is whether or not something which was created is alive, and saying that \'it was created, therefore it is not alive\' does not satisfy.\n\nA significant amount of a human\'s mass is not human, but bacteria. Cells in organics come in all manner of shapes and functions, from cells which have no nuclei to cells which have only one set of chromosomes and do not reproduce. As more components turn to using transistors as their base, this is likely to consolidate, but I do see the point. This characteristic is one of the more debatable ones, and I am open to discussing it as much as any other, but I think that this is where the characteristics of life need to be \'stretchy\' in nature, since they should be able to apply to intelligences the likes of which we have yet to conceive. It is a weak point, but on its own I am not likely to be convinced otherwise by pursuing this point. You are welcome to try.\n\n&gt; Everything uses energy. In terms of life, this is interpreted as a metabolism that harnesses energy via chemical compounds to do useful tasks. I\'m not certain that raw use of electricity is the same.\n\nSemantics will be important here. Not everything *uses* energy, that implies purpose. Energy *exists* in all things, all systems *have* energy, reactions *transfer* energy, but let\'s beware teleological statements where they do not belong. Computers take energy and each subdivision of where that energy goes has some function in the emergent system. I think it is appropriate to apply ""uses"" to synthetics.\n\n&gt; Computers are programmed to respond. A conscious entity writes the code which is then implemented. Were there to be a truly learning, independent, and adaptive code, that would be a strong arguement.\n\nThis has been around for a while: [A robot teaches itself to walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNL5-0_T1D0) Here, ""a robot can teach itself to walk without any knowledge of its form and function"". It\'s a start, but I don\'t see why we can\'t extrapolate that advancement in this field will continue to the point where machine learning is capable of much more.\n\nAlso, here is a similar project using the same robot, but with the intent of adapting to and [healing damage to itself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh20JMEI-FI)\n\n&gt; Computers don\'t expand. We expand them. All organismal growth happens via cell duplication or enlargement. All computer growth is via modular addition of new, unrelated parts.\n\nThis is a problem. Perhaps the point would be less weak once synthetics can upgrade themselves, but the core of the problem remain. The additions are modular. I am also worried about how important this particular characteristic is to life; there are organisms which cease to grow at points, or hibernate so deeply there is no cell growth. They grew during their infancy, their creation; but that\'s like saying that a computer \'grew\' because when it was put together, the size of the overall parts increased. Worth pursuing.\n\n&gt; They do build things, but not themselves. Any organism (or pair for those with distinct sexes) can create a new, complete, identical organism. I can\'t think of any cases where machines build identical copies, like some fictitious nanobots.\n\nI am not worried so much about what is currently used. Eventually computers will build computers without human aid. The characteristic is fulfilled.\n\n&gt; Again, they don\'t adapt to the environment independently. We adapt them to the environment.\n\nAgain, it is not so much a matter of what is possible now. Currently, your phone camera will automatically adjust itself to the lighting situation. This is already done programmatically. There is no reason this cannot also be abstracted to the point where adaptation affects multiple systems in a synthetic.\n\nBesides, I think this one has more to do with evolution than with a single member of a population. In that case, of course computers can determine adaptations which should be made to their own structure so that they can be applied to a new generation.\n\nThanks for your input!', 'ups': 2, 'author': 'boolean_in_principle', 'controversiality': 0, 'link_id': 't3_1zhqip', 'subreddit': 'changemyview', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2w2s8', 'removal_reason': None, 'downs': 0, 'children': [{'distinguished': None, 'level': 2, 'gilded': 0, 'parent_id': 't1_cftugf1', 'body': ""Okay.

However, these characteristics need to be very extensible in order to qualify computers as alive; this is necessary if we ever plan on categorizing some alien life we hadn't conceived of as alive. I think computers exhibit the properties at least in the following ways.

-1. ""Composed of cells""

Well, computers do have a fundamental unit which is central to their existence: the transistor.

-2. ""Emergent properties/levels of organization""

Certainly anyone who understands processor architecture sees that there are many levels of complexity upon which the others lie, from hardware all the way up to software. Computers also have specialized components, ""organs"".

-3. ""Uses energy""

Some would say they use too much energy.

-4. ""Responds to environment""

Computers are regularly programmed to respond to their environment, be it to users, or robots to stimuli, or weather systems to changes in readings.

-5. ""Grows""

This is a tough one, but certainly through upgrades computers can expand not only their capabilities but also their physical form, if that is important to this definition.

-6. ""Reproduces""

I don't think this is as tricky as it sounds. Bots build bots. The physical forms factors of some members are capable of building other things, we use them to build cars, toys, and yes, computers. This capability will only extend from where it is today.

-7. ""Adapts to environment""

This is perhaps the most nebulous one. This involves the most complex aspects of programming such that a computer will better suit itself to its environment or task. But it certainly exists, like when rovers close shop to weather a sandstorm. If adaptations are traits giving an advantage in the environment, then upgrades can be determined and applied to the next generation at will.

Computers exhibit all of the characteristics of life, in one form or another, and eventually these will come together, and beyond that become recognizable as sentient and intelligent.
