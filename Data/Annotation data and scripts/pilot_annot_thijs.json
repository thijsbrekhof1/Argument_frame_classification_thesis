Imagine human knowledge as a circle.\n\nPreviously, humans learned very general things. You can imagine the total knowledge as a circle with a small radii representing depth and the interior of an arc as the breadth of the individuals knowledge. The breadth of knowledge was necessary as food shortages forced any one member into a variety of roles. As advancements in food came about, individuals were able to specialize and gain more knowledge in any one field while sacrificing knowledge in other fields. This can be represented as the circle of human knowledge expanding while the individual's slice becoming smaller. As humans become more and more specialized due to a larger and larger food surplus driving population growth, a given individual will be able to continually expand human knowledge, while knowing a lesser breadth.\n\nSo while human knowledge expansion may slow down, the limiting factor is not the knowledge itself but food surplus. It the rate of human growth slows down, then knowledge expansion will slow down but not until then.\n\nFor a further analogy to how this works, look at Kepler's law of equal areas: an imaginary line drawn from the center of the sun to the center of the planet will sweep out equal areas in equal intervals of time","comment_id":"d1pyynw","thread_title":"CMV: The exponential increase in human knowledge and technology will be slowed down because of the limited amount of knowledge acquirable in a human lifetime."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-28T15:33:14.358050Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T17:55:16.113332Z","project":6},{"id":401,"annotations":[{"id":392,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Other"]},"id":"mFHiq4juGc","from_name":"topic","to_name":"comment2","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-29T17:54:36.662506Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T17:54:36.662533Z","lead_time":16.761,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":401,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"d993f7b1-comments_for_anno.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_4dat5a","comment_text":"After college\/graduate school the rate at which adults learn stuff slows down dramatically.

Remember that education is a field that is also being actively researched as of late. Having been through the public education system I would argue that the majority of student time is spent performing useless tasks that ultimately did not contribute to their understanding of some crucial subject matter. Already, the rise of the internet has made a huge difference in dropping the learning curve for some serious subject matter. This has made it possible for teenagers to make it to Silicon Valley, and ingenuity to come from unlikely places. There is still a huge room for advancement in the fields of education, and who knows what kinds of advances will improve this system?\n\nCurrently, the process of becoming an expert in a field who is able to contribute meaningful research to its development requires about 20-25 years of education. Of those, only 5-10 are spent studying material that is directly pertinent to that field. We can definitely do better in this regard. A restructuring of K-12 curriculum to eliminate waste and introduce important emerging fields could be one of the first steps towards this end. Better methods to absorb and retain information could exponentially decrease the amount of time spent learning, and thus completely negate or even reverse the effects you mentioned.\n\nWhile I can't say for sure which forces will push harder in either direction, you should also consider that knowledge is becoming more easily accessible and the process of accessing that information under critical development.

The reason I don't believe this will happen (at least not in the near future-- the introduction of advanced deep learning tech will almost certainly produce information that is beyond the grasp of human knowledge today.) is because once we discover something, teaching that thing is almost infinitely easier than the time it took to discover that thing. Computers are a great example-- they took almost a century from the prototypical idea of a computer to a computer that would be somewhat recognizable today, and have accelerated greatly over the past 3 decades. However, if you're a computer scientist, you probably spend at most a few classes learning all of that information throughout your academic life. \n\nCalculus is the same way. It took (essentially) one guy to write the rules to calculus, something no one before him really grasped, and now anyone interested in mathematics can learn that information in a year or two. \n\nEssentially it boils down to the fact that you don't have to \"relearn\" the info in every human life time.

It does not force private companies to provide a platform for groups they strongly disagree with to use to spread their ideas.","comment_id":"dloh21t","thread_title":"CMV: Banning the hate groups from having websites or places to express their opinion is a bad thing"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-28T15:33:14.355909Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T17:34:39.274800Z","project":6},{"id":367,"annotations":[{"id":358,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Political"]},"id":"raeXHnH9oC","from_name":"topic","to_name":"comment2","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-29T17:33:20.483103Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T17:33:20.483349Z","lead_time":30.725,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":367,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"d993f7b1-comments_for_anno.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_6tsx1p","comment_text":"I have a position you may not have heard:\n\nTheir politics and movement are not new.

The decision of google to censor someone can effectively cripple their right to free speech. This can be resolved in two manners to my mind.

I get that the book is about him, but with any great character are his counterparts. \n\nTake Severus for example, he is a fantastic and brilliant character who brings a lot to the series. He is a great catalyst for hp and he brings an interesting view to the fold. He shows that devotion and loyalty truly are Harrys, and the series, defining characteristics.\n\nLupin, another large influence on hp with little recognition amongst this thread. He too, gives Harry a fair amount of personality in book 3 as a leading cause for the heroic path that Harry will inevitably partake in, and helping him confront that dark that he fears.\n\nLastly, I'll touch on Sirius. Among many hp fans he is the favorite. He leads the effort in elaborating on the conflict Harry continously endures, the loss of loved ones. He brings so much to the table for the series as a perspective that's recognizably the traits we appreciate from Harry: bravery, strength of will, and loyalty.\n\nMy point with all this is that the book is about Harry, but too much focus on him will obscure the rest of the denizens and what they bring. Harry is NOTHING without his companions, like any great character.

Especially if you watch the first two movies, they aren't spectacular stories, but man do they capture the imagination of kids. I still remember the first time Harry went to Hogwarts both in the books I read, and the movies I watched. I remember when I was sick for a week my mom would read the books to me until I feel asleep. \n\nHarry Potter is to my generation as say the 80's was to an older generation. If you weren't a part of it, you would say \"what the hell are they wearing, and what were you thinking?\" But they will say it was the greatest decade of their life. Right or wrong, you can't really rate someones life experience, and I wouldn't expect someone like my dad to understand why Harry Potter was so important to my generation. So the quality really isn't that important honestly, it's about nostalgia and representing a generations childhood. I am in no way a fanatic now that I am older, but whenever anyone brings it up, I think back to when I was a kid. \n\nIf you go into a Young Adult genre movie\/book and expect serious literature, you are probably in for a bad time.

Food stamps have not solved the problem of hunger, governmental housing has not solved the problem with homelessness, and the EPA is a lousy, ineffective governmental program.

Sure, Apple tries to paint them in the best possible light, but this is something all companies do with their own products. \n\nI also do not agree on their products being 'overpriced', at least not for all their products. They fill a niche market, but they fill it very well and for a very reasonable price. Take the 12\" macbook for example. Sure, you can get more processing power, memory and storage for less money but those aren't the selling points of the laptop. Portability is (and yes, aesthetics are as well). I seriously doubt you could find another laptop that has:\n\n- A total weight of 920 grams\n- A thickness of 13mm \n- A 1440p 16:10 screen\n- 256GB of storage and 8GB ram\n- A completely fanless design\n\nFor $1,299 or less. Then there are the obvious advantages of being able to simultaneously run (for instance) a fully functional MS Office suite next to a bash terminal. Like it or not, those things are important to some people. Sure, it has a 1.1GHz processor that's on par with a 2007-era Core2Duo but Apple doesn't sell processing power when it sells a 12\" Macbook. Portability and aesthetics may not be what you want to buy when shopping for a laptop, but it is for other people.\n\nIf you were able to get the same for less from a different company, then it would in my opinion be fair to call it overpriced, but I'm pretty sure you can't.

So I will only try to change or at least relativize a specific one:\n\n&gt; People often say that Mac is better for developers than Windows, but having used Windows, OS X, and Linux, I can say with certainty that OS X is the least capable of the three. The amount of available software that can run on OS X is minimal compared to Windows. For developers, Linux is superior, with greater customization and an enormous online community for help (as opposed to having to contact Apple tech support). And the best part? Linux is FREE.\n\nI am a developer for more than 10 years and worked with Windows, Linux and Mac. The biggest problem when changing from one OS to a new one is that you're not used to it. I never owned a Mac myself and working for the first time with it feels super annoying. But that's not really something that you can hold against an OS. \n\nThe amount of tools isn't really a factor either as long as you have the right tools available. Do you have examples of tools that are missing on OSX? I never heard any of our developers who are using a Mac say: \"Sorry, I cannot do that, there is no tool that can do that.\"\n\nGreater customization also isn't a relevant factor for me, I am also not even sure what you mean by greater customization and how it is supposed to help me as a developer.\n\nFor the support: while I agree that there is a big community (though I cannot imagine that you won't find any help for Windows or OSX problems), most development problems are OS independent.

If apple can remove the headphone jack and add something like even a 5% increase in battery (as that jack is really pretty big as far as components go), that trade off is going to be beneficial to a large majority of their users.

On an anecdotal note, I’ve owned an iPhone 7 since October 2016 and I still have and use my original adapter every day. I even bought a spare to use at the gym.

Police make communities safer from obvious crime with their presence or by taking action against criminals. So that is their purpose.

If there was no army, this would fall on to the police forces in the communities, because people\/companies\/governments still want stuff. Essentially, you would still need an army to function as a country, or form alliances with someone who has one. Trade is the ONLY other way we can overcome this, by increasing access to resources for everyone and reducing the effectiveness of an army over time.

In this world there will always be someone who tries to assert dominance or control over others, and is also reflected in global politics. Soldiers arent the weapon, they are a tool weilded by world leaders. Without them there are many other ways to wage war.  \n\nSource: did a term paper on Hobbes' Leviathan in a political theory class\n","comment_id":"dbg97f2","thread_title":"CMV: If you become a soldier willingly, you are perpetuating war."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-28T15:33:14.338875Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T11:50:43.001672Z","project":6},{"id":123,"annotations":[{"id":121,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Security and defense"]},"id":"O0sn85jdIV","from_name":"topic","to_name":"comment2","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-29T11:50:20.254542Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T11:50:20.254571Z","lead_time":43.419,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":123,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"d993f7b1-comments_for_anno.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_5jfqhp","comment_text":"&gt; CMV: If you become a soldier willingly, you are perpetuating war.\n\nI read your opening post, but could not find any argument that are relevant to the CMV prompt. Reading your responses to others, it seems to me that your argument against the deterrent argument is that the opposing force would also have no army. That's doesn't make sense. \n\nThe reality is that other nations have military forces. Not having a military force puts your country at risk of being exploited. Regardless of your choices, or the choices of people in your nation, it will not change the fact that peoples from other nations have militaries and will continue to maintain them. Historically, wars of unification are sought with a justification to end all wars by putting everyone under one banner. That is a situation where one power exerts overwhelming power to enforce peace. You hope for another way. The premise of that way must be one where your nation can still get the results of having a deterrent force without actually having one, while allowing the rights of other nation states to maintain forces of their own.\n\nIf you can solve that,  and you'll deserve the nobel peace prize. Without that, soldiers serving their nation are not perpetuating war. On the contrary, they are perpetuating peace. The peace that exists right now.

But here goes!\n\nYour view is one of many in a greater debate about the fundamental nature of mankind: If civilization were removed - with its national pride and drive for resources taken with it - would mankind be peaceful, or violent? \n\nUnfortunately, the question itself is moot; whether or not mankind as a whole were peaceful is irrelevant because there only needs to be violent individuals, few and far between, to trigger cycles of violence. These violent individuals will have to be met with violence in order to insure the survival of the whole. One this has happened, it is no longer just these individuals who must be considered violent; it is the home. TL;DR: Humans are violent.\n\nSo, if country A does not have a military, only police, and country B *does* have a military, country B *will* exploit the situation. History shows this happens time and time again. Until a global order is established, countries will compete for resources. This competition sometimes delves into violence, because that is a fundamental aspect of our species. Hopefully, we will eventually evolve out of it. In the meantime, we have not, and war is guaranteed to exist somewhere in the world.  \n\nFollowing this model, volunteering to serve doesn't make you a perpetrator of war - only a participant in something that would be happening whether you were there or not. Global peace will be a consequence of a shift in philosophy and emotional maturity by the entire species over time, not the actions or inactions of a single person.

So mentally disabled people have benefit to their parents, in some cases, because they bring their parents happiness and avoid pain for them.

Try meeting one for change. \n\nMy personal experience was in high school. I visited a school for the mentally restarted with the goal of engaging in activities. Although the kids were hard to handle, however, it didn't stop us from having fun. They were responsive and attentive, they rarely complained or disturbed other classes, and it seemed like they had unlimited energy to squander. \n\n","comment_id":"dl99p38","thread_title":"CMV Knowingly Having (Mentally) Retarded Children is Morally Wrong"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-28T15:33:14.331573Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T11:01:59.843342Z","project":6},{"id":39,"annotations":[{"id":38,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Morality"]},"id":"mRXV8K65MI","from_name":"topic","to_name":"comment2","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-29T11:01:07.768712Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T11:01:07.768743Z","lead_time":7.773,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":39,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"d993f7b1-comments_for_anno.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_6rwcio","comment_text":"Morally wrong to have a downs baby?

That is, how do we know (for sure) beforehand that these newborns will be 'mentally retarded' as you say?\n\nIntellectual and cognitive disability is not a discrete issue, there is a spectrum of intelligence, and whilst some genetic diseases like Down syndrome are quite clearly associated with intellectual disability, we really have little way of knowing to what extent these individuals will suffer from learning problem until after birth as they begin to grow and develop. Down babies can and do have normal or subnormal IQs. Moreover there are an innumerable number of other factors that contribute to intellectual disability, which even today cannot be predicted to any degree before birth.\n\nSo how does this factor into your idea? Your conclusion would seem to suggest that we should abort all those suspected of having such a disability, which no doubt would include many many otherwise healthy babies. That or we indiscriminately suggest abortion for only one type of disease? What about others? You say this is justified because it's a drain on society and the state, but what about others who would fall into this category (pregnant women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, pregnant drug addicts, etc). Would you support they get an abortion too? If not, isn't that unfair?\n\nI think it's a slippery slope and the state should not suggest one way or another to intervene.

We sterilized schizophrenic patients in an attempt to curb the overwhelming numbers of new schizophrenia cases. Germany of course dabbled with racial (and medical) eugenics during the war. The question of consent was a non starter in both cases; schizophrenics technically could not give consent to be sterilized because of their mental capacity (and because of being under the influence of heavy medication), and of course no one in Germany gave consent to anything, but sterilizations (and deaths in Germany's case) were carried out regardless \"for the good of the people\". **neither scenario played out well in the end\n\n\nIn the case of aborting fetuses that show abnormalities, were arguing free will.

You could even argue that applying value or utility to any human life is immoral. Assuming too that science should run our lives and having the best possible human specimens is subjective. Some may argue that compassion and love have done more for the human kind than what you've mentioned. \n\nThe largest problem here is that there's is an assumption on the value of a person's life. Ones a certain amount of money mean more than an individual. What about those who choose not to work, but depend on tax money? What about prisoners who cost tax payers 30,000 a year to imprison? Should we all haul them into a ditch and bury it? That would be truly immoral. \n\n","comment_id":"dl9aqfc","thread_title":"CMV Knowingly Having (Mentally) Retarded Children is Morally Wrong"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-28T15:33:14.330087Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T16:27:19.413967Z","project":6},{"id":3,"annotations":[{"id":5,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Other"]},"id":"dKOJp3O6qP","from_name":"topic","to_name":"comment2","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-28T16:26:44.406364Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T16:26:44.406396Z","lead_time":78.253,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"d993f7b1-comments_for_anno.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_6rwcio","comment_text":"While I agree with you to a large extent, there is a spectrum to retardation.

Where does it stop. Who chooses who is acceptable to live. Who chooses who is worth the cost. Put yourself on the scale and you were born with an illness. Would you want someone to access your cost on society. Calculate whether or not you may be productive in those circumstances, and decide if you were an acceptable risk? It could get to the point that the government would not want to pay or allow anybody on Medicare to have a baby with any congenital birth defects or foreseeable medical problems. \n\nIs that the type of world we live in? The closest we have to that is China. There restrictions on babies. It has caused harm. But that is nothing close to what you are suggesting. But you know that.
