When you say things like \"drain on society\" or \"taxpayer burden\", these pots are only running dry because politicians don't know how to handle the money. For every person who takes more than they give, there are several people who give more than they take. Most of the people in America don't see a dime of social program money until they turn 65, but they start contributing to them at 16 (or whenever they get their first job). Given how few people have Down's Syndrome, we can afford to help them. It's a pretty small number of people. \n\n2. This is a very slippery slope. Deciding who will have too poor a quality of life is a Pandora's box that should stay closed. You can start with Down's Syndrome babies-once it's been \"successful\" and they aren't costing anyone any more money, people will undoubtedly look for the next disposable group of people who are high-cost and low-producing. It'll probably be those with severe heart defects or sickle cell anemia-or some kind of disease that prevents you from holding down a steady job-and then trickle down to the mentally ill, those with depression and anxiety, and eventually, after a hundred years, we'll have winnowed down our gene pool to only \"perfect\" qualities.

If there was no army, this would fall on to the police forces in the communities, because people/companies/governments still want stuff. Essentially, you would still need an army to function as a country, or form alliances with someone who has one.

According to the US Department of Transport, there are two kinds of acceptable \"bumping\" from overbooked flights: voluntary and involuntary.  Voluntary bumping is the most frequent type, and this is what you normally see when the airline offers you incentives to voluntarily take a later flight.  Carriers are given a lot of freedom in how they negotiate with passengers in order to get volunteers, but it is frequently in the carrier's interest to get volunteers.  This is due to the regulations around involuntary bumping.  \n\nInvoluntary bumping requires the airline to arrange alternative travel arrangements that get the customer to their intended destination within 1 hour of their original scheduled arrival time.  If the customer arrives between 1 and 2 hours late, the carrier is forced to pay significant penalties to the customer for the inconvenience.  Any more than 2 hours incurs a 400% penalty that the carrier must pay to the customer.  This is all to protect the customer from overzealous overbooking.

My issue with your approach is with treating them as an outright curiousity.

You aren't setting out to provide historical truths of divinity, but using extremely well known stories to teach lessons. For example, David and Goliath is about overcoming a seemingly insurmountable disadvantage with a creative approach (beat the huge guy from distance rather than the way he wants). You might not get a lot of life lessons out of Noah's Ark, but you can tie it into other Great Flood stories like the Epic of Gilgamesh. That leads to discussions on how such different cultures developed- or built upon- the same mythologies. \n\n\nLong story short, I think turning your back on the literature and mythology of religious texts closes off a lot of lessons about our histories and what guides certain cultures even today. You have a big opportunity to open the door to some of the oldest parables that people hold dear.

So let's take this to basic human growth with puberty. The FtM transitioned early enough in their life to impact their hormones during the major growth periods in their life, meaning they have the testosterone of a boy their age and their muscles will develop the same way a biological boy would. The MtF, which I'm taking a guess here as I have not found any information saying so, went through puberty as a male, meaning they had their muscles develop on the lines of a biological male before transitioning, giving her an unfair advantage over top of her competitors. They do have rules against this, like her testosterone levels needed to be below 10 nanomoles/liter meaning she contained as much testosterone as her biological female competitors during and 12 months prior to the competition. She also competed as a male body builder prior to her reassignment, meaning she more than likely passed puberty as a biological male which would give her an unfair advantage.

Modern dogs have evolved alongside humans to perform all kinds of different tasks; we have bred them to hunt, herd, and guard for us.

Similarly, science may be our best bet at finding the answers behind things, but like any person, a scientist is vulnerable to mistakes, corruption, etc. \n\n\nIf you don't consider the ambiguity of a word, you are bound to make a lot of errors in communication. This is why most scientific terms have very strict definitions. \n\n\nThe problem with all ideas of truth is you can never rid any argument of at least a minute degree of uncertainty. Science generally only minimizes that uncertainty, it can't claim that anything is a perfect truth above any skepticism, as skepticism is an essential part of science's success. \n\n\nIn some ways a perception is truer than any fact because it represents the ideas of the holder as accurately as words can describe. Saying: \"I think being gay is disgusting\" does not mean that as a fact all gays are disgusting, but it usually means that the idea that the person holds that view is nearly completely factual.
