Remember that education is a field that is also being actively researched as of late. Having been through the public education system I would argue that the majority of student time is spent performing useless tasks that ultimately did not contribute to their understanding of some crucial subject matter. Already, the rise of the internet has made a huge difference in dropping the learning curve for some serious subject matter. This has made it possible for teenagers to make it to Silicon Valley, and ingenuity to come from unlikely places. There is still a huge room for advancement in the fields of education, and who knows what kinds of advances will improve this system?\n\nCurrently, the process of becoming an expert in a field who is able to contribute meaningful research to its development requires about 20-25 years of education. Of those, only 5-10 are spent studying material that is directly pertinent to that field. We can definitely do better in this regard. A restructuring of K-12 curriculum to eliminate waste and introduce important emerging fields could be one of the first steps towards this end. Better methods to absorb and retain information could exponentially decrease the amount of time spent learning, and thus completely negate or even reverse the effects you mentioned.\n\nWhile I can't say for sure which forces will push harder in either direction, you should also consider that knowledge is becoming more easily accessible and the process of accessing that information under critical development.

The reason I don't believe this will happen (at least not in the near future-- the introduction of advanced deep learning tech will almost certainly produce information that is beyond the grasp of human knowledge today.) is because once we discover something, teaching that thing is almost infinitely easier than the time it took to discover that thing. Computers are a great example-- they took almost a century from the prototypical idea of a computer to a computer that would be somewhat recognizable today, and have accelerated greatly over the past 3 decades. However, if you're a computer scientist, you probably spend at most a few classes learning all of that information throughout your academic life. \n\nCalculus is the same way. It took (essentially) one guy to write the rules to calculus, something no one before him really grasped, and now anyone interested in mathematics can learn that information in a year or two. \n\nEssentially it boils down to the fact that you don't have to \"relearn\" the info in every human life time.

They can cause damage to people, either trough ridicule or through harassment. And most importantly words can cause people to act. There was an Swiss Imam that called for Muslims that don't pray the right way to be burned. His words can literally cause the death of others.

He shows that devotion and loyalty truly are Harrys, and the series, defining characteristics.\n\nLupin, another large influence on hp with little recognition amongst this thread. He too, gives Harry a fair amount of personality in book 3 as a leading cause for the heroic path that Harry will inevitably partake in, and helping him confront that dark that he fears.\n\nLastly, I'll touch on Sirius. Among many hp fans he is the favorite. He leads the effort in elaborating on the conflict Harry continously endures, the loss of loved ones. He brings so much to the table for the series as a perspective that's recognizably the traits we appreciate from Harry: bravery, strength of will, and loyalty.\n\nMy point with all this is that the book is about Harry, but too much focus on him will obscure the rest of the denizens and what they bring.

People seem to have already argued the characters and writing, but I just want to put it in context. \n\nThe first Harry Potter movie came out right as I was finishing 5th grade. It's a Young Adult genre story. Kid with a crappy life finds out he is actually part of this story that both happened and is currently happening. Especially if you watch the first two movies, they aren't spectacular stories, but man do they capture the imagination of kids. I still remember the first time Harry went to Hogwarts both in the books I read, and the movies I watched. I remember when I was sick for a week my mom would read the books to me until I feel asleep. \n\nHarry Potter is to my generation as say the 80's was to an older generation. If you weren't a part of it, you would say \"what the hell are they wearing, and what were you thinking?\" But they will say it was the greatest decade of their life. Right or wrong, you can't really rate someones life experience, and I wouldn't expect someone like my dad to understand why Harry Potter was so important to my generation. So the quality really isn't that important honestly, it's about nostalgia and representing a generations childhood. I am in no way a fanatic now that I am older, but whenever anyone brings it up, I think back to when I was a kid. \n\nIf you go into a Young Adult genre movie\/book and expect serious literature, you are probably in for a bad time.

Most modern websites are too HTML heavy (and they're getting worse) to run on slow connections.

All these things tend to be expensive or hard to find in developing areas. However, doing this requires someone skilled in using the Internet and computers in general, and it's very difficult for someone with only occasional Internet usage to get these things done.

This is only one index and others may have different rankings, but I think it's clear that both the US and Germany are similar in overall quality of life, while having strengths in different areas.","comment_id":"d3vz0dj","thread_title":"CMV: Germany,as long as you are not rich, is better then the US in every single way."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-28T15:56:19.475626Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T09:43:25.630637Z","project":4},{"id":212,"annotations":[{"id":213,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Quality of Life"]},"id":"MNESRb7_zi","from_name":"topic","to_name":"comment2","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-05-04T09:38:10.062239Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T09:38:10.062239Z","lead_time":81.76,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":212,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"56592a9a-comments_for_anno_1.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_4mj8v7","comment_text":"I have lived in both Germany and the US.\n\nBoth are great countries.\n\nLife in Germany is like going to Starbucks.

It's true that overall the political spectrum in Europe is more left wing but it really isn't that much different. E.g. Sanders wouldn't be considered a moderate in Europe either. He wouldn't be considered an extremist but he would be one the more radical side within mainstream left wing parties. So in Germany you have the SPD, the Green and Die Linke. Sanders would be considered very left wing within the SPD, which is the biggest left wing party, and better fit into Die Linke. But they aren't moderates, they are the most left wing mainstream party. Sanders would be in the range of the 10-30% most left wing voters.\n\nAlso someone like Trump isn't actually that extreme by European standards. For example his views on immigration are very standard for far right wing parties here and such parties usually get something between 10-30% of the votes. \n\nThe real difference is religion. E.g. in the 2016 US primaries Cruz was actually (by far) the most extreme candidate by European standards.

I seriously doubt you could find another laptop that has:\n\n- A total weight of 920 grams\n- A thickness of 13mm \n- A 1440p 16:10 screen\n- 256GB of storage and 8GB ram\n- A completely fanless design\n\nFor $1,299 or less. Then there are the obvious advantages of being able to simultaneously run (for instance) a fully functional MS Office suite next to a bash terminal. Like it or not, those things are important to some people. Sure, it has a 1.1GHz processor that's on par with a 2007-era Core2Duo but Apple doesn't sell processing power when it sells a 12\" Macbook. Portability and aesthetics may not be what you want to buy when shopping for a laptop, but it is for other people.\n\nIf you were able to get the same for less from a different company, then it would in my opinion be fair to call it overpriced, but I'm pretty sure you can't.

If apple can remove the headphone jack and add something like even a 5% increase in battery (as that jack is really pretty big as far as components go), that trade off is going to be beneficial to a large majority of their users.

I’ve said this before elsewhere but it’s not really apple’s fault that people are careless and lose their things. You could kinda argue Apple’s intentions in that regard. Maybe they show malice here because they realize that people are careless and will likely have to buy a new adapter. Apple, however, has stated on several occasions that their goal is wireless. On an anecdotal note, I’ve owned an iPhone 7 since October 2016 and I still have and use my original adapter every day. I even bought a spare to use at the gym. Also, keep in mind, that most people just use the pair of earbuds they got in the box with their phone - which in the case of the iPhone 7\/+ and 8\/+ is a pair of lightning EarPods.\n\nI also maintain that apple’s cables are built well. Generally speaking, however, people treat the cables like shit. Again, not apple’s fault. Again, maybe Apple knows that people treat cables like shit so they make a cable that works but needs to be replaced when it’s treated poorly. I buy Apple cables because I don’t treat mine like shit and I’d rather buy something that definitely isn’t gonna fry my battery - I’m cautious even with MFi certified products.\n\nThe compatibility of software and hardware is a double edged sword.

True, Google release ARCore around the same time and other companies like Nvidia and Qualcomm are making big strides in computer vision, but a lot of what Apple did was in house and to a higher standard, and naturally those R&amp;D costs are passed down to consumers in the cost of the phones.

And part of that is because Apple maintains full control over their hardware and software. Not all android phones work as well as one another. But all iPhones work pretty much as well as any other iPhone. Maybe with a couple more bells and whistles on the latest version. But my 4 year old iPad runs just as well as my wife's 1 year old iPad mini and I haven't found an android tablet manufacturer that has come close to that kind of consistency.

Police make communities safer from obvious crime with their presence or by taking action against criminals. So that is their purpose.

If there was no army, this would fall on to the police forces in the communities, because people\/companies\/governments still want stuff. Essentially, you would still need an army to function as a country, or form alliances with someone who has one. Trade is the ONLY other way we can overcome this, by increasing access to resources for everyone and reducing the effectiveness of an army over time.

Reading your responses to others, it seems to me that your argument against the deterrent argument is that the opposing force would also have no army. That's doesn't make sense. \n\nThe reality is that other nations have military forces. Not having a military force puts your country at risk of being exploited. Regardless of your choices, or the choices of people in your nation, it will not change the fact that peoples from other nations have militaries and will continue to maintain them. Historically, wars of unification are sought with a justification to end all wars by putting everyone under one banner. That is a situation where one power exerts overwhelming power to enforce peace. You hope for another way.

But here goes!\n\nYour view is one of many in a greater debate about the fundamental nature of mankind: If civilization were removed - with its national pride and drive for resources taken with it - would mankind be peaceful, or violent? \n\nUnfortunately, the question itself is moot; whether or not mankind as a whole were peaceful is irrelevant because there only needs to be violent individuals, few and far between, to trigger cycles of violence. These violent individuals will have to be met with violence in order to insure the survival of the whole. One this has happened, it is no longer just these individuals who must be considered violent; it is the home. TL;DR: Humans are violent.\n\nSo, if country A does not have a military, only police, and country B *does* have a military, country B *will* exploit the situation. History shows this happens time and time again. Until a global order is established, countries will compete for resources. This competition sometimes delves into violence, because that is a fundamental aspect of our species. Hopefully, we will eventually evolve out of it. In the meantime, we have not, and war is guaranteed to exist somewhere in the world.  \n\nFollowing this model, volunteering to serve doesn't make you a perpetrator of war - only a participant in something that would be happening whether you were there or not. Global peace will be a consequence of a shift in philosophy and emotional maturity by the entire species over time, not the actions or inactions of a single person.

That is, how do we know (for sure) beforehand that these newborns will be 'mentally retarded' as you say?\n\nIntellectual and cognitive disability is not a discrete issue, there is a spectrum of intelligence, and whilst some genetic diseases like Down syndrome are quite clearly associated with intellectual disability, we really have little way of knowing to what extent these individuals will suffer from learning problem until after birth as they begin to grow and develop. Down babies can and do have normal or subnormal IQs. Moreover there are an innumerable number of other factors that contribute to intellectual disability, which even today cannot be predicted to any degree before birth.\n\nSo how does this factor into your idea? Your conclusion would seem to suggest that we should abort all those suspected of having such a disability, which no doubt would include many many otherwise healthy babies. That or we indiscriminately suggest abortion for only one type of disease? What about others? You say this is justified because it's a drain on society and the state, but what about others who would fall into this category (pregnant women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, pregnant drug addicts, etc). Would you support they get an abortion too? If not, isn't that unfair?\n\nI think it's a slippery slope and the state should not suggest one way or another to intervene.

The question of consent was a non starter in both cases; schizophrenics technically could not give consent to be sterilized because of their mental capacity (and because of being under the influence of heavy medication), and of course no one in Germany gave consent to anything, but sterilizations (and deaths in Germany's case) were carried out regardless \"for the good of the people\". **neither scenario played out well in the end\n\n\nIn the case of aborting fetuses that show abnormalities, were arguing free will. Should a person carrying a fetus with downs be allowed to practice free will and decide to keep it or abort on their own, or should someone step in and take away that free will to mandate an abortion? \n\n\nIn a moral sense, there really is no argument because everyone's moral compass is different and based off of individual experiences culminated over a lifetime. Some people morally oppose abortion; how would that be handled? Some people morally oppose even having sonograms or genetic testing done on (unborn) children, what then since they didn't know ahead of time? \n\n\nEdit because apparently I can't spell anything this morning","comment_id":"dl8j0ob","thread_title":"CMV Knowingly Having (Mentally) Retarded Children is Morally Wrong"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-28T15:56:19.442562Z","updated_at":"2022-05-01T17:44:23.731993Z","project":4},{"id":7,"annotations":[{"id":8,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Capacity and resources"]},"id":"17Nx-75WTn","from_name":"topic","to_name":"comment2","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-05-01T17:42:52.067373Z","updated_at":"2022-05-01T17:42:52.067373Z","lead_time":147.623,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":7,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"56592a9a-comments_for_anno_1.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_6rwcio","comment_text":"If you use a purely capitalist view of persons having value, euthanasia of severely developmentally disabled persons makes sense.\n\nIf you acknowledge the reality that all work, whether paid or unpaid, significantly adds value to households, organizations, and societies, then it's plain that many of the developmentally disabled persons (such as those with Downs) add far more value than they cost.\n\nWhen it comes to extremely developmentally disabled infants with conditions recognized as \"incompatible with life\" (such as those with Edwards or anencephaly), I would generally remain with your original stance of euthanasia.","comment_id":"dl92oit","thread_title":"CMV Knowingly Having (Mentally) Retarded Children is Morally Wrong"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-28T15:56:19.442562Z","updated_at":"2022-05-01T17:42:52.099828Z","project":4},{"id":6,"annotations":[{"id":7,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Morality"]},"id":"1Cg8M7B-Kl","from_name":"topic","to_name":"comment2","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-05-01T17:40:24.129275Z","updated_at":"2022-05-01T17:40:24.129275Z","lead_time":18.199,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"56592a9a-comments_for_anno_1.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_6rwcio","comment_text":"Are you talking about people carrying the gene who know for a fact that they will be having mentally retarded children?

When you say things like \"drain on society\" or \"taxpayer burden\", these pots are only running dry because politicians don't know how to handle the money. For every person who takes more than they give, there are several people who give more than they take. Most of the people in America don't see a dime of social program money until they turn 65, but they start contributing to them at 16 (or whenever they get their first job). Given how few people have Down's Syndrome, we can afford to help them. It's a pretty small number of people. \n\n2. This is a very slippery slope. Deciding who will have too poor a quality of life is a Pandora's box that should stay closed. You can start with Down's Syndrome babies-once it's been \"successful\" and they aren't costing anyone any more money, people will undoubtedly look for the next disposable group of people who are high-cost and low-producing. It'll probably be those with severe heart defects or sickle cell anemia-or some kind of disease that prevents you from holding down a steady job-and then trickle down to the mentally ill, those with depression and anxiety, and eventually, after a hundred years, we'll have winnowed down our gene pool to only \"perfect\" qualities. If this sounds extreme, just think about the small, tiny ways the most extreme things have been started.
