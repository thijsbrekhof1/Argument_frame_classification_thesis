A child with a tough, but manageable condition, is a child that deserves our respect and protection.  There are cases where there is really no hope, where an unborn child will not develop a brain for instance, in which case the question of euthanasia is legitimate, but that would apply to a 5 year old as well as a fetus.  

I don't think mental conditions are immoral to prevent in theory, but it depends on the specifics.  Gene editing is very ethically different than aborting a 2 month old fetus.  In general I agree that people without downs syndrome are capable of living richer lives than those with it, But I would be disgusted by the suggestion that someone be euthanized merely because they have downs.

But in practice, eugenics has always been a failed science. 


The US experimented with eugenics in mental hospitals before WWII. We sterilized schizophrenic patients in an attempt to curb the overwhelming numbers of new schizophrenia cases. Germany of course dabbled with racial (and medical) eugenics during the war. The question of consent was a non starter in both cases; schizophrenics technically could not give consent to be sterilized because of their mental capacity (and because of being under the influence of heavy medication), and of course no one in Germany gave consent to anything, but sterilizations (and deaths in Germany's case) were carried out regardless ""for the good of the people"". **neither scenario played out well in the end


In the case of aborting fetuses that show abnormalities, were arguing free will. Should a person carrying a fetus with downs be allowed to practice free will and decide to keep it or abort on their own, or should someone step in and take away that free will to mandate an abortion? 


In a moral sense, there really is no argument because everyone's moral compass is different and based off of individual experiences culminated over a lifetime.

I have a couple of thoughts about your view. 

The first is that while you're not advocating for me or people like me to be killed, you are advocating that myself and people like should never have been born to begin with. Which, for future generations of people like me, kind of amounts to the same thing; non-existence. I'm wondering what gives you, or anyone else for that matter, the moral authority to say whether or not I should exist?

Your argument seems to be that we're a burden on society, without redeeming value to justify that burden. To this I would urge you to explore the many, varied, and wonderful contributions disabled people have made to society. Much like you, many of us are a part of a community of friends, family, &amp; neighbors, and participate in a mutual enriching of one another's lives. Like some abled people, some disabled people even make broader contributions to society, often by applying their own unique perspective.

At what point do someone's contributions become irrelevant, and do you think science will be able to accurately predict which disabled people have the potential to be good friend/family/neighbors/members of society and which will fall below this hypothetical threshold?

To counter this view, I think you can look at the history of people with disabilities as an ongoing effort to appreciate their talents. One of the famous examples of this is Temple Grandin. She is autistic and used her perspective on the world to innovate how we treat livestock. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Grandin

You can reply by saying that she is ""higher level"" and that there are people who are too developmentally delayed to be anything but a burden. However, can you be certain that this is an absolute fact?

Intellectual and cognitive disability is not a discrete issue, there is a spectrum of intelligence, and whilst some genetic diseases like Down syndrome are quite clearly associated with intellectual disability, we really have little way of knowing to what extent these individuals will suffer from learning problem until after birth as they begin to grow and develop. Down babies can and do have normal or subnormal IQs. Moreover there are an innumerable number of other factors that contribute to intellectual disability, which even today cannot be predicted to any degree before birth.

So how does this factor into your idea? Your conclusion would seem to suggest that we should abort all those suspected of having such a disability, which no doubt would include many many otherwise healthy babies. That or we indiscriminately suggest abortion for only one type of disease? What about others? You say this is justified because it's a drain on society and the state, but what about others who would fall into this category (pregnant women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, pregnant drug addicts, etc).

&gt; White children are more likely to move up the ladder while black children are more likely to fall down. 

&gt; More than one third (37 percent) of white children born to parents in the middle income group move up to the fourth or fifth quintile, compared to only 17 percent of black children whose parents have approximately the same levels of income.

&gt; Startlingly, almost half (45 percent) of black children whose parents were solidly middle class end up falling to the bottom of the income distribution, compared to only 16 percent of white children.

[Check out this piece by Peggy McIntosh](http://nationalseedproject.org/white-privilege-unpacking-the-invisible-knapsack). Much of what we mean when we talk about white privilege comes from this article from 1989. It lists many things that are invisible to white people and don't involve money, such as 

* I can if I wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race most of the time.
* When I am told about our national heritage or about “civilization,” I am shown that people of my color made it what it is.
* I can go into a music shop and count on finding the music of my race represented, into a supermarket and find the staple foods that fit with my cultural traditions, into a hairdresser’s shop and find someone who can cut my hair.
* I am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group.
* I can turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my race widely represented.

All of these are very real to most non-whites. Financial advantage is a separate, though often connected, issue. Privilege has as much to do with not having to worry about alienation and isolation, or the possibility of physical harm, as it does with being financially secure. 

Edit: Actually McIntosh explicitly says, ""I decided to try to work on myself at least by identifying some of the daily effects of white privilege in my life.

The other part of this is that if this were criminalised, the state would have to take action against parents with obese children. It'd be lovely to think that a visit from a dietician and a social worker would do the trick, but given that habits are very hard to break, in many cases the family wouldn't substantially alter their behaviour. At this point, what happens? In traditional child neglect/abuse scenarios, if a home visit and maybe some sort of support (in this case maybe vouchers for healthy food or free vegetable delivery or something), if the situation doesn't improve, the state would be compelled to remove the child from the home and place them in foster care. 

This in and of itself is traumatising to the child (and is associated with a dramatically increased risk of future drug abuse, teen/unwed pregnancy, mental health problems, etc) and they'd have to remain in care until the parent - what? - learns to cook healthy meals?

316,t3_4clvbk,"Evidence suggests that obesity isn't a simple matter of calories in/calories out. That may be true in most cases but there appears to, at least some of the time, be a genetic component. How will you tell the difference? Should it be criminal if I have a fat child but I myself am fat and there's a genetic predisposition to it that runs in the family? And if you say no, how do you determine who gets a ""genetic pass"" and who doesn't? 

Putting the genetic argument aside, what about the notion of poverty? It's a pretty well-known theory (I'm not sure it's a fact per say) that lower-income families often cannot afford to eat healthy. Indeed, we hear a lot about how the foods that are the worst for you are often the cheapest and most readily available. Wouldn't your criminalization idea tend to disproportionately affect the poor then? How long before people were, rightly so I'd say, up in arms about that? Aren't you effectively just rubbing salt in the wound by punishing a parent in a disadvantaged family for something they are probably actively trying to change but maybe can't as easily as they themselves would like to? 

I think it's probably true that obese children are at least some of the time the result of parents not doing their job right.

Not true. You need fats for brain function. Unsaturated fats are good for you (to a certain extent, like everything) and you need a certain amount of fat every day or you won't be very happy (not processing proteins, vision issues, skin problems, and increased risk of dementia/alzheimer's).

Some children steal food from the pantry, other students at school, or find other ways to get food that their parent may not know about.

A parent can't force a child to be active or exercise, especially if that child has a physical ailment or disability like asthma, etc. Many parents don't have the ability to constantly monitor a child's food intake or activity level, as they're away from the home a lot of the time (working long hours, for example). Plus any kid with a decent level of autonomy and an allowance can walk/bike to the local store and buy as much junk food as they like.

A child might have a decent diet, but if the combination of their physiology and activity level causes their weight to rocket out of control, how much blame can you put on the parents. Schools are cutting phys ed classes and recess, communities are bucking against youth sports leagues that put emphasis on performance (which entails conditioning), parents are more fearful of letting kids outside to play, especially as crime/violence escalates in some communities.

One example is that my family must repair their own roads when river flooding washes out bridges. Similarly neighbors coordinate together to fight wildfires.

Even back then the US wasn't very free. Democracy existed for a long time before that. Civil rights existed before that with the Bill of Rights 1689, the Magna Carta and France expanded civil rights with their Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen a lot more than the US did.

And technically the US did not achieve full and complete universal suffrage until 1965 with the abolition of poll taxes which was used to disenfranchise minorities. 


The US abolished slavery nearly 30 years after the British Empire did for example and after the French Empire. Mexico abolished slavery before the US.

334,t3_6ithkj,"&gt; An example: Freedom of movement in nature. In Nordic countries (where I am from) everyone can go to public forests and hang around there, making camp, picking up berries and mushrooms or firewood, and as long as you do not disturb others or nature, it is your right to be there. As I am aware, this is not a thing in USA, but very much a basic freedom here in Nordic countries. If there is a forest or a hill, you are allowed to go there and stay. No one will threaten to shoot you for doing so.

You can absolutely do this in the US. Most US states have large areas set aside as public lands and parks. You can generally hunt, hike, camp, watch birds, fish, pick mushrooms and berries, and so on. Depending the specific reserve there maybe additional rules, but public land usage is a big part of our culture.  

&gt; n USA this is only theoretical possibility. Like in some former communist countries, where you could vote, but if you did not vote the party favored candidate, you vote did not actually matter and your candidate did not get elected.

A number of independent candidates have been elected to national and state offices that have ran as independents. I'll agree it isn't as prevalent as it should be, but not impossible.

In essence, you are asking if it's morally wrong to voluntarily damage the body in order to achieve some personal goal, and I think we could include body piercings and tattoos to achieve some sort of outward appearance, anabolic steroid use to achieve some physical goal, etc. And yes, these all involve damage to the body and health risks, and in rare cases, death.

I think it would be difficult for anyone to refute this statement without gettting into natural law theory. However, particularly with physical appearance, I would argue that if it is possible to find success through other means that do not risk bodily health, than these means would be morally better than plastic surgery.

193,t3_6h7a4i,"I guess this depends on what you consider moral? I think it's *understandable* that someone would get plastic surgery and I don't judge anyone for it because I think you're right, most of the time attractiveness grants you positive privileges. But I would argue that it's possibly immoral and here's why, gonna try to keep this concise 

I think you're right that attractive people generally have easier lives than unattractive people. I think it's also (indisputably) true that people with more money also have easier lives. Plastic surgery is expensive, thus the only people who can get it are those with the means to do so. Meaning that plastic surgery will only enhance the lives of those who already have a better life than those who can't afford it. Therefore, normalizing plastic surgery creates a further divide in the quality of life between the (for lack of a better term) poor and ugly and the more affluent and beautiful (whether natural or not).

So in conclusion, I definitely think plastic surgery is beneficial for your own self interest. However for society as a whole, it seems at best neutral (CMV?) and at worst detrimental by widening the ""quality of life"" gap between the poor and the (relatively) affluent, and therefore isn't moral

TL;DR people who can afford plastic surgery already have a better quality of life than those who can't --&gt; normalizing plastic surgery could result in more inequality --&gt; plastic surgery is amoral at best but arguably immoral   ",diwmr69,"CMV: apart from very specific circumstances, attractive people have a huge advantage over unattractive people in every way of life, therefore I see nothing wrong with getting cosmetic surgery to make myself look better",1271,1,1244,2022-05-14T13:22:59.755358Z,2022-05-14T13:22:59.755391Z,65.268,Morality

They can put you on guard if you're not into them (you feel inferior) or they can make you nervous or finicky if you are. 

If you want to succeed in life, you need social skills not looks, and if you get looks now you're not going to develop social skills.

207,t3_6h7a4i,"I would argue that being attractive has disadvantages in certain situations. For example, being an attractive female in a professional work environment can be  a considerable disadvantage, especially if your coworkers and/or supervisors are predominately female as well.  I have seen many female coworkers judge other female coworkers by saying they got a promotion ect. specifically because they were attractive, not because of their merits as a worker. I have also seen coworkers being accused of sleeping with the boss, ect. to get promotions, simply because they were attractive or because of how they dressed.  I would argue that females who are attractive are judged more on that, and presumed to be less competent by other females than their unattractive or average coworkers. 

I have however found that in a predominately male environment, being an attractive member of the opposite sex may have a temporary advantage. I say temporary, because when competing against other less attractive female coworkers I feel that I may have a slight advantage, however when competing against other male coworkers I may have a slight disadvantage if the boss only sees my physical appearance and sees my male counter-parts intelligence.

Then, the woman has a child with you and the kid has a cleft chin, where did that come from? 

Of course, this is an extremely obscure example but it is used just for effect. Same with hair transplants, balding early may be a bad genetic sign to some women, as is a hooked nose, a double chin, dark under eyes, etc. 

I believe the best time to get cosmetic surgery is once you are in a committed relationship, so that you are changing you for you, and not to get a partner or to benefit others. The partner would be on board ideally, and already know how your genes looked originally.

http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-laz-iphonecost-20140917-story.html

If we assume the iPhone X costs around $400 to make, and sells for $1000, that is not as huge of a margin as you might think.  Also if you compare it to something like household furniture which is often marked up 200-400%, its not that bad.

Some of these calculations of the real cost of the phone also don't include labor and other costs, and instead just add up the cost of the individual components inside the phone.

Other costs include the marketing and creating the ""brand"" you mentioned in the CMV.  Also Apple has a history of in-house R&amp;D and making its own components, the new Apple A11 is just the newest example of this.  

Finally, its also a pretty objective fact that Apple knows what it's doing.  If you look at the history, and how it was quite recently the most valuable corporation in the world. The new iPhone might launch it back up there again.

You also have to ask yourself what are the other companies doing? Oh yeah Samsung phones burst into flames sometimes.  The head of Samsung is likely going to spend sometime in jail, convicted on corruption charges, their company is constantly involved with scandals.

People don't understand how many hard problems Apple has solved in computer vision with its AR software because most see it as nothing more than a small feature in a list, but AR is more than a feature, it's the platform for the future and incredibly difficult to pull off given the current state of technology. True, Google release ARCore around the same time and other companies like Nvidia and Qualcomm are making big strides in computer vision, but a lot of what Apple did was in house and to a higher standard, and naturally those R&amp;D costs are passed down to consumers in the cost of the phones. Just seeing what Apple is able to do by levying computer vision on its camera software is spellbinding.

The phones themselves, on a hardware level, may be valued at $2-300 but when you account for everything else that went into it... I think $1000 or so is reasonable. If you don't see the value or potential in these new features, you really don't need to have the latest model iPhone as any phone from the last three years should suffice.

I’ve said this before elsewhere but it’s not really apple’s fault that people are careless and lose their things. You could kinda argue Apple’s intentions in that regard. Maybe they show malice here because they realize that people are careless and will likely have to buy a new adapter. Apple, however, has stated on several occasions that their goal is wireless. On an anecdotal note, I’ve owned an iPhone 7 since October 2016 and I still have and use my original adapter every day. I even bought a spare to use at the gym. Also, keep in mind, that most people just use the pair of earbuds they got in the box with their phone - which in the case of the iPhone 7/+ and 8/+ is a pair of lightning EarPods.

I also maintain that apple’s cables are built well. Generally speaking, however, people treat the cables like shit. Again, not apple’s fault. Again, maybe Apple knows that people treat cables like shit so they make a cable that works but needs to be replaced when it’s treated poorly. I buy Apple cables because I don’t treat mine like shit and I’d rather buy something that definitely isn’t gonna fry my battery - I’m cautious even with MFi certified products.

&gt; People often say that Mac is better for developers than Windows, but having used Windows, OS X, and Linux, I can say with certainty that OS X is the least capable of the three. The amount of available software that can run on OS X is minimal compared to Windows. For developers, Linux is superior, with greater customization and an enormous online community for help (as opposed to having to contact Apple tech support). And the best part? Linux is FREE.

I am a developer for more than 10 years and worked with Windows, Linux and Mac. The biggest problem when changing from one OS to a new one is that you're not used to it. I never owned a Mac myself and working for the first time with it feels super annoying. But that's not really something that you can hold against an OS. 

The amount of tools isn't really a factor either as long as you have the right tools available. Do you have examples of tools that are missing on OSX? I never heard any of our developers who are using a Mac say: ""Sorry, I cannot do that, there is no tool that can do that.""

Greater customization also isn't a relevant factor for me, I am also not even sure what you mean by greater customization and how it is supposed to help me as a developer.

For the support: while I agree that there is a big community (though I cannot imagine that you won't find any help for Windows or OSX problems), most development problems are OS independent.

It's also less troublesome than using Linux as my workstation. I've done so in the past, and I find that I constantly argued with Linux in a way that I almost never have to do with MacOS. (And I'm a *Linux professional*; I can't imagine what it's like for a novice.)

I also do not agree on their products being 'overpriced', at least not for all their products. They fill a niche market, but they fill it very well and for a very reasonable price. Take the 12"" macbook for example. Sure, you can get more processing power, memory and storage for less money but those aren't the selling points of the laptop. Portability is (and yes, aesthetics are as well). I seriously doubt you could find another laptop that has:

- A total weight of 920 grams
- A thickness of 13mm 
- A 1440p 16:10 screen
- 256GB of storage and 8GB ram
- A completely fanless design

For $1,299 or less. Then there are the obvious advantages of being able to simultaneously run (for instance) a fully functional MS Office suite next to a bash terminal. Like it or not, those things are important to some people. Sure, it has a 1.1GHz processor that's on par with a 2007-era Core2Duo but Apple doesn't sell processing power when it sells a 12"" Macbook. Portability and aesthetics may not be what you want to buy when shopping for a laptop, but it is for other people.

However we are equally American. My point here being that there isn't a cut and dry definition of American culture and by extension, no cut and dry definition of what makes you an American aside from the obvious,  having citizenship. 

One thing that makes America great is the various cultures. The Midwest was largely settled by Germanic and Scandanavian peoples so the culture reflects that. Texas largely settled by Mexicans and Spaniards but we have areas with large German and Czech populations. 

Your racial identity isn't what makes you American as much as your citizenship does. Your accent doesn't matter as I have a very different accent from my cousins and we are all american. Your skin color doesn't as I am darker than some cousins, lighter than others but we are equally American.

I would expand the way you look at statuses of foreigner and natives. For example, a white Caucasian male born and raised in NYC will be a foreigner in rural Alabama. A black woman born and raised in Chicago will be a foreigner in the whitest parts of Connecticut.

I feel like you should present some of the well-known bible stories (and other major religions) in the same way you would introduce the popular Greek/Roman/other myths, or Aesop's Fables. You aren't setting out to provide historical truths of divinity, but using extremely well known stories to teach lessons. For example, David and Goliath is about overcoming a seemingly insurmountable disadvantage with a creative approach (beat the huge guy from distance rather than the way he wants). You might not get a lot of life lessons out of Noah's Ark, but you can tie it into other Great Flood stories like the Epic of Gilgamesh. That leads to discussions on how such different cultures developed- or built upon- the same mythologies. 


Long story short, I think turning your back on the literature and mythology of religious texts closes off a lot of lessons about our histories and what guides certain cultures even today. You have a big opportunity to open the door to some of the oldest parables that people hold dear.

You're making the exact same mistake as religious conservative parents.  You think what you say matters.  You think the values you speak will have any influence on the values they hold as adults.

The truth is, we teach our children 99% by example, good and bad.  How many parents have you heard complaining about how ""kids just don't listen""?  Well, it's basically true.  If they *ask* you, they will listen to your answer and weigh it.  If you speak at them, they'll basically just write you off.  They may hear the words you speak, but they watch what you do more.

Children very often rebel against their parents.  How many liberal people do you know who have ultra conservative parents?  Do you think that only happens one way!?

If you want to teach your children the value of logic and reason and anti-bigotry then you must *live it*.  If you preach to them that religious people are illogical bigots, their first experience with someone who is religious and logical and not a bigot will shake their faith *in you*, because you have set a negative example.

Buddhism teaches you some basics that gives you tools to grasp not just reality and your own mind but the behavior of others. For the purposes of your post the central one being ""makyo"" or delusion:

- Every experience you have is a delusion because the brain simulates the world and presents you with a literal hallucination that you think is ""seeing"". This explains dreams, seeing things in the corner of your eye that aren't there, not seeing the blind spot, seeing UFOs etc.
- The base state of a brain is confusion. This explains why crazy religions exists when there is no basis for them. It also explains most of the evil caused by humans in the world. It also teaches you compassion towards criminals and fanatics because you understand that they are just overcome with delusion. It also explains why we don't punish children with jail time when they strike other children.

Prior to exposure to religion, I've taught my child to be a free thinker and to respect the beliefs of others. I've taught my child that a person's beliefs are their core and that it's important to remember that a person is a sum of their experiences, and their experiences will not match mine or those of anyone else. 

As my child got older, my child's peers started talking about God, heaven and hell. I've expressed to my child that she can believe whatever she would like to, as long as she is properly informed. Ultimately, I will let her make her own decisions as long as she takes the time to do the research and learn about the different systems of beliefs to find whatever makes the most sense to her.

With that being said, the concept of a god is illogical to her. The idea that there's this omnipresence that judges your every move is creepy, and to be told that murder is bad, but our soldiers who murder innocent people are saved by this Christian god doesn't make sense to her at all. 

The key to parenting, with anything that you strongly believe, is to instill the tools and confidence your child needs to make the right decision, and as far as faith is concerned, that is a deeply personal decision. If you teach your child logic and rationality, and teach them to be informed, not only will they realize exactly how illogical religion is, it gives them the tools to realize the world around them and how there's a lot that may not make sense to them, but they aren't going to go and attack people about it either.

How did you reach that conclusion? I have no experience with feeling that my body is the wrong gender; do you? If transgender people are saying they experience this at a younger age, who are you to question it? The state of being transgender isn't a decision that comes from consideration of facts. It's just something you experience.

This kind of argument used to be popular for sexual orientation. I never decided to be straight or gay, but I knew which gender I was interested in at a young age. How is being transgender any different?

&gt; This is problematic because the transgender community faces discrimination, mental health issues (depression, suicide, etc), and generally more problems than someone who isn't transgender.

Many of the mental health issues stem from experiencing gender dysphoria. What you are proposing makes the situation *worse* since you want to prolong that experience by not accepting their decision.

However with a unified currency, the exchange rate is based on the Eurozone as a whole. This means a strong economy like Germany gets to use the same exchange rate as Greece. Germany gets to use a weaker exchange rate and gets a huge export boost, while Greece is stuck with high exchange rates, high labor costs, and an noncompetitive economy.

He basically has the intelligence and reasoning of a ten or twelve year old kid, though he is in his fifties now. Think 'Forest Gump.' Currently he has taken up leatherworking and seems to like that, but not as much as he likes to play videogames. It took me playing WoW for a year to try raiding. He jumped in right away because he is basically fearless, and not afraid of failure. He laughs when people call him retarded, and says, ""Well I am!"" He put up with so much shit in high school that insults lost all meaning.

I know he is a rare exception, but I love him very much and am proud of him every day. He loves sarcasm and thinks I am the funniest person alive. He's a pretty cool cat.

You probably think they won't ever have some semblance of happiness, but that couldn't be further from the truth.  It's education and involvement, just like with ""normal"" kids.

People with disabilities can continue their lives to be completely happy, and can even hold jobs and help out in many ways.  It's also useful to blend populations of ""normal"" kids and those who are disabled, as both can learn from each other.

My theory is that there is nothing intrinsic in a given field that makes us love it. What we love instead are the specific tasks and actions that we perform when immersed in that field.

What I'm trying to say is, the qualification in itself is only one part of a much wider package. We have some great executives who have a degree in a foreign language, for example, as well as being great at their job with an impressive CV. They're part of a much more well-rounded package. I know an accountant who had a degree in computer science, he got the accounting qualification later, but can bring so much more to his role than someone who just knows bog-standard basic excel.

What, exactly, determines ""little interest""? I have a little interest in cars, but I don't think that means I should suddenly pursue becoming a mechanic because I think cars are neat and heavy duty mechanics make a decent wage. Essentially, I think most people have *at least* a little interest in nearly every discipline out there. Using that logic, I would then, according to your stipulation, necessarily pick the highest paying alternative. 

I also think you're not considering the vastness and depth of the job market. Many disciplines cross paths. For example, business and sociology. Many of things we learn in sociology (and even psychology, etc.) directly correlate with things we learn in business.  One could take either a business or a sociology degree and focus on one particular usage. Instead of focusing on the job market, I think what you're really concerned with is how people *perceive* particular degrees. As a business student, I can tell you that much of what I've learned in my first year classes wasn't nearly as relevant as some things I learned in my first year sociology class. It's all about how you use the information. It's not all about the degree, but how you use the information to benefit your position. 

TL;DR - Society's perception of particular degrees influences how useful we think the information in. It's not necessarily the degree's fault, or what an individual is learning from the courses found in it, but instead a problem with societal perception of usefulness.

In my life (or anyone's life), i need a certain amount of happiness. If i do a job i like only a little, it gives me only a little happiness. That's not enough for me, i want to enjoy life more. So, i would need to do activities or outings to be happier. Those cost money. So, the happier i want to be, the more it will cost me. Money comes in from the job, and goes out for activities. 

If i have a job that i really enjoy (which is currently my case), after my 8 hour day, i had a lot of fun. I enjoyed my day. At the end of the week, i don't need to go out and do anything to be happier, i already enjoyed my week. I may have made a bit less, but i don't need to spend anything as a result so it's not such a big difference. Not only that, but i work side jobs in my field on my spare time. Since i love my job, it makes me even happier to go out and work, while making even more money. So in the end, I'm being paid to have fun on my time off that i spend with friends. 

Not to mention the fact that i love my job means im always looking for new ways to improve my work, always willing and eager to learn. It makes me very valuable to employers. As others have mentioned, it gives you security. And i still make as much per year as someone who makes more but doesn't enjoy their job as much.

We are given certain sanctified mysteries in our lives by God called sacraments. Among the most important of these sacraments is the sacrament of marriage between a man and a woman in order to procreate in fulfillment the commandment to ""go forth and multiply."" Additionally, we are commanded to do all things in love of our fellow human beings and for our love of God. The improper condoning or participating in sins is bad enough, but when we are called to condone or participate in something that perverts our sacrament is blasphemous and puts us in danger of Hell. 

Along these lines, yes, it is even a sin to go to a wedding that isn't done under the auspices of the Church if you are Catholic. Technically, two Lutherans getting married should be as repugnant as two men getting married. They are all fornicating and committing mortal sin.  Forcing a devout Christian to bake a cake for a gay wedding (or a Lutheran wedding) is tantamount to forcing an Orthodox Jew to get a tattoo. 

That is the general argument that an devout Catholic will make. I don't espouse it myself, and I have been to plenty of weddings for friends of mine who happen to be gay.

169,t3_6qb8s8,"Please forgive any confusion I can cause: I'm trying to explain an extremely complex topic in a foreign language.

It is important to understand why gay relationships are sinful. Catholics (the original christian religion) values unity and being selfless. Being selfless is keeping nothing for oneself. Regarding to love and specially sex, being selfless strongly relates to fertility and nature: The objective is reproduction and any artificial attempts to prevent it are sinful: This include contraceptives, abortion, and homosexuality.

Cointraceptives are sinful because they prevent nature taking place. There's one exception to this, and they are the ""natural methods"", of which you can ask about in r/catholicism.

Abortion is a sin because it kills a human being (two when it goes wrong).

Homosexuality is a sin for the same reason contraceptives are: They have no other reason to exist than pleasure itself, and so can't be selfless.

Since marriage is the only way to get non-sinful sex, and it is supposed to lead to a natural family, the only marriage allowed is between a man and a woman. People who don't know about catholicism and fertility might argue that this excludes infertile people, but it is not so simple: Infertility is a wide range of fertility issues: You will rarely find a couple who has either 100% or 0% fertility. Also, it's an anomaly, and they might still conceive with a little help. Gay couples are always at 0% fertility, and this isn't an anomaly, but the rule. And artificially causing your fertility to drop is a sin.",dkweq0e,"CMV: Christians generally complaining about gay marriage are defending their power to impose, not their right to practice, their religion.",2217,1,1338,2022-05-19T14:38:34.813165Z,2022-05-19T14:38:34.813165Z,107.698,Cultural identity
162,t3_6qb8s8,"I think I can be of some help here.  
  
According to the Catholic Church, all Catholics must get married in The Church.  We have a procedure for getting married, there are steps to follow, and they usually are, no problem.  So long as a Catholic gets married within The Church, there are no problems.  
  
Outside of The Church, people receive natural marriages.  To receive a natural marriage is not a sin, since the people receiving a natural marriage are not beholden to Catholic doctrine.  However, certain principles must be upheld in order for a natural marriage to be recognizable to a Catholic.  It must not end in divorce, or be the product of a divorce.  It must be of each party's own volition, and it must follow Natural Law.  
  
According to Catholics, and many Christians(as far as I know) the entire Universe is ordered to Natural Law.  Natural Law is basically is basically saying, ""God made the Universe *this* way, and He did it for a reason.""  Natural Law has something to say about everything.  Regarding sexuality, Natural Law states that human bodies are ordered to fit together a certain way, and that the natural result of that will eventually lead to new life.    
  
To go against Natural Law, according to Christianity, is a sin.  Christians are told not to support sins, and to instead provide help and support to individuals who are in a state of sin, because being in a state of sin means turning your back on God, and we don't want you to be in such a state any longer.  The only way a Christian would be allowed to participate in a gay wedding is if they were held against their will or were completely unaware of the spiritual consequences.

The secular establishment is going to outperform the Christian counterpart due to its doors being open to a larger portion of the population, and maybe even putting the Christian establishment out of business.

This was to preempt Jim crow era policies which explicitly prohibited businesses from serving blacks and whites together, creating a two tiered economy that made it impossible for blacks to succeed. Over the years federal law has been updated to include protections for gender and disability, but not sexual orientation. Some states have passed their own laws protecting LGTBQ status, but states are still free to do the reverse. 

However, the current set of laws being passed has a slightly different context then being discussed. This involves businesses being compelled to facilitate the actual gay marriages themselves. The most notable example is a wedding photographer, who I believe was trying to seek relief from a state law, claiming that her occupation was artistic and that in photographing the wedding she was being compelled to support something that violated her religious beliefs. 

I personally support gay marriage rights. I'm not a Christian. However, I think in this narrow case the plaintiff had a just claim.

And many of you probably disagree, but if you do, please tell me you also disagree with other business discrimination that is totally legal, such as based on age or sex, gyms, pools, hair salons, and many other things can be segregated, why is race/sexuality so special? I think the only differences really are A) sexual hang ups B) the history of the race/sexuality discrimination.

This is a terribly inconsistent law set, either discrimination is ethical to allow or it's not, they shouldn't pick and choose based on categories.

Btw I also think I should be able to turn down a KKK member or ex-member purely for that reason, or neo Nazi or whatever it may be, but I don't see how that wouldn't be hypocritical if Christians couldn't also turn down gay people.",dkwiomv,"CMV: Christians generally complaining about gay marriage are defending their power to impose, not their right to practice, their religion.",2195,1,1316,2022-05-19T14:14:09.455601Z,2022-05-19T14:14:09.456600Z,163.628,"Legality, constitutionality and jurisprudence"

OK so, catering or making a cake for a gay wedding is not the same as, say, refusing to serve a slice of pizza to someone who is gay. 

On essence, by catering you are becoming a part of the wedding. You are giving your blessing and in many religions, food is very important and could even represent the flesh of your savior (yuck)  so for them, a cake is much more than just fat and sugar. It is the very blessing of the baker. It is being complicit in the act. And they believe the act itself is a sin. Thereby forcing them to commit a sin by being complicit in the act

Also, you were saying in another comment that then a server at a restaurant shouldn't serve a few teens because they may think they'll have premarital sex... Two distinctions, the server probably doesn't own the business, and providing food doesn't directly contribute to premarital sex like, say, selling a condom does.  Providing food directly contributes to feeding them, and what they do afterwards is largely unrelated to service at a restaurant. 

For a Christian, it can be compared to owning a gun shop and selling a gun to someone who just told them they're about to kill someone. They believe someday they'll have to stand before God who will ask why they did that for them when they knew what it was for and when they believed it was wrong, like the gun shop owner would stand in front of the police/judge who would ask them the same question. Important to note is they believe a sin is a sin and all sins are equal in the sight of God (many Christians struggle putting that belief to action though, something I'm sure you've noticed).

Depression, suicide, loved ones, whatever. None of that has anything to do with anything. They are choosing their own desires, right or wrong, over those of others, right or wrong. That is selfish.

745,t3_72cx8c,"The biggest issue with suicide because of depression being selfish is that what's selfish is completely subjective. Let's say I'm living with roommates in college and one of them asks me to do the dishes, but I don't want to. Is it selfish of me to want to spend my time doing the dishes? Or is it selfish of my roommate to think his time is more important than doing the dishes and that I should be the one to do them? Most people would say that I'm selfish in that situation, but what if I was working a full time job and the roommate didn't have a job, would it change anything?

As another example let's say there are two 7 year-olds and one is given a chocolate bar and he wants to eat the whole thing by himself. Is it selfish if that child eats the whole thing? Or is it selfish of the other kid to expect him to share. Would that opinion change if the kid given the chocolate bar came from a wealthy, well fed family and the other kid came from a poorer family?

Depending on your situation and circumstances you might view the situations different from somebody else. While a depressed person committing suicide may not view their actions as selfish, from the perspective of friends and family it's completely valid that they will believe it to be a selfish action and it's unlikely anyone would be able to change their mind.

If a person is commiting suicide, most likely (but not always), he is doing it for his own internal reasons. If he is hurting or doesn't see benefit or living, or whatever, and commits suicide​, he has done a cost-benefit analysis and come to the conclusion that loving is worse than dying, therefore he commits suicide. Therefore, the reasoning is purely based on his own benefit, therefore selfish.

Exceptions to suicide would be if he is doing it for the benefit of others (maybe to get insurance money for his children? Maybe to save someone's life? )

But if it's done due to depression, that exception is even fewer. Unless it's something like, ""Due to my depression, I can't make my family happy, so with me dead, my wife will remarry and this will create a better life for my children and my wife"", but it's extremely unlikely that is the reasoning for the majority of suicides.

Let's say you're stuck on an island, and the only means to improve your chances of survival is to cooperate with the other unlucky fella. Is it selfish to cooperate? Does selfishness really have to exclude others' benefit?

When dealing with someone suicidal, there will always be a conflict of interest. The situation is inherently irrational and the suicidal person is demonstrably incapable of making rational decisions, for the following reasons:

Suicide is often enough motivated by the idea that ""my life isn't worth living and it won't become worth living in the future."" No matter how correct this assumption is, the only way to make the opposite happen, is to live and try to change the situation. The status quo is obviously torture enough as it is. 

Suicide ""by depression"" is a self-fulfilling prophecy. In suicide, the depressed actively contributes to the aforementioned idea becoming fact. Only by making real changes to your life - and probably getting the occasional push from someone supportive - can your life become worth living.

Suicidal tendencies and motivations, and the will to live a pleasing life, are feedback loops. But both can be said satisfy you (in more or less stupid ways), and are therefore selfish. But only one of these can truly benefit others in addition to yourself.

Suicide is selfish, like most other decisions in life.

781,t3_72cx8c,"OP, I think it may be easy to think the way you are thinking when you yourself are feeling depressed. Yes, depression can make a person think quite irrationally, but that doesn't justify the way you choose to act on those thoughts- the action of suicide is still selfish. It spares you of your pain (one person) over the pain of many, it is saying you are more important than anybody else and your pain should be prioritized. 

No, I am NOT saying your pain isn't important. But other people are in pain, too- it is all about finding a treatment that works for you. I firmly believe that if you feel hopeless because nothing is working, it's not because nothing can save you, it's just that you haven't found it yet. Keep looking. Everyone is different and responds to medications, therapy etc. differently, so you can't honestly say there's ""no hope"" it just means you haven't put forth enough effort. That's like saying you can't find a job and it's been several years- one must wonder, have you really been applying everywhere? Have you gone in, asked questions? There is bound to be something if you search for it hard enough.

I think this is the key piece that we should focus on. What would your goal be? Would you like to allow other people to copy and sell the work for money after 20 years instead of 170?

From society's point of view, what would be the difference today? Someone will do the selling. With an endless amount of competition from other content creators, they wouldn't be able to, and it also wouldn't be in their interest to charge a prohibitive amount. Whoever is doing the selling will still need to charge something. Whether it's paper, or CD's, or bandwidth, or hosting a website, or lastly, time, there will be some non zero cost.

There was a time when you might be forced to buy bundled things that you didn't want. $20 dollars for a VHS movie meant you were forced to buy packaging (A significant cost), and an insurance premium in case the retailer couldn't move inventory (retailer margin, even larger than packaging). But today, there is very little argument left for this. You can watch a movie over the internet for close to nothing, bypassing any unwanted packaging and physical media, and there's no risk premium that you need to pay for the seller's inventory risks.

I'm not really sure you want to see changed. Even if you could legally copy a movie, you'd still have to go and buy media to store it on, and/or internet to transfer it, or be forced to watch ads. It will never be completely free. If you spend $100 to buy a hard drive, and end up watching 1000 movies, you're still spending at least 10 cents per movie, and haven't added up internet costs yet.",d5atfay,CMV: Copyright protection should last 15 to 20 years at most.,2053,1,1174,2022-05-19T10:07:22.827448Z,2022-05-19T10:07:22.827448Z,20.483,Historical

A) It is made clear that it is not officially licensed, i.e. fan fiction sold at a bookstore would have a disclaimer on the back cover that it is fan fiction, so that the original copyright holder can still maintain an official canon as they please without consumers being confused. 

B) The original copyright holder is entitled to seek out royalties. This should work similar to the current rules for recording cover songs. Currently, you do not need permission to sell a recording of your performance of a copyrighted song but you are expect to pay royalties based on your sales (i.e. if you don't successfully sell a single copy, you owe nothing, if your cover ends up selling millions, the song writer is legally entitled to a pretty nice check). Applying this for derivative works means that you don't have authors being screwed because Hollywood waited 15 years to make the film spin off and you don't see a single cent or even a line in the credits for the story that you wrote.

It takes time and effort to create an original work, so I think it is only fair that this work should be protected to a reasonable amount of time - so you'd be able to exclusively reap the benefits for said creation.

347,t3_4sntrj,"&gt;The premise is this: If you create something, it becomes part of the culture in which you live.

This really isn't the premise. The premise of copyright (and patents, etc.) is this: Having people create things is good for society, even if we give them exclusive rights to sell those things, and people would create much less if they didn't have those exclusive rights.

So we give them exclusive rights, because we want them to create, even if that means that they are the only ones that can profit from them.

Even with copyright, people are free to allow something to become part of culture immediately if they want to. Evidence suggests that that is not what motivates people to create... otherwise they would do that. People create largely because they can make a living (and potentially a reasonable retirement) off of their creations.

Society is benefited *no matter* who profits from the creation, simply by the fact of creation. Even an *infinite* copyright term would be a good bet for society if, indeed, it got people to create significantly more.

The *vast* majority of stuff is forgotten even in 15-20 years.

Say, To Kill a Mockingbird and Go Set a Watchman if we accept Go Set a Watchman as a sequel (although it of course has some dubious publication history that make this unlikely). It's unfair to the creator to force them to publish constantly, rather than let them publish when and if creativity and novel ideas strike them.

Artists who are interested in being creative have had no problem continuing to publish despite wealth - take J.K. Rowling or numerous musical artists. And, if a piece of art can support its creator for life, it has certainly been adopted into popular culture.

The renewal period allows for the quick passage of most works into the public domain, while allowing for commercially viable works to remain so for many years to come. The 50 year maximum is long enough that even for most works that are still commercially viable, the creator would have likely retired or died, so a longer copyright duration is unlikely to encourage more creation (which is supposed to be the entire point of copyright).

The renewal system is a direct response to the problem of abandoned works under copyright, which are no longer used by the owner, but can also not be used by anyone else, often because the owner cannot be found.

I object to this part. There is more to happiness/satisfaction/contentness/whatever than just not suffering. You can be varying degrees of happy.

A world where a few people suffer and many are super-happy is better than a world where nobody suffers and nobody is happy. We can argue about different types of doing the calculation, like whether it's total happiness or average happiness that matters, but in both cases a world with no people will be either mediocre (average utility zero) or terrible (total utility zero).

Most people don't kill themselves, so we can be confident that most people think their lives have more happiness than suffering. Extinguishing them will reduce more happiness than it would reduce suffering, driving both total and average value *down*.

EDIT: One objection you have that is related to that is

&gt; So-called higher pleasures - art, music, intellectual pursuits - are all subservient to these needs, as they either function to A: distract us from unmet needs in ourselves or others or B: exist to facilitate the goal of meeting these needs. 

If this were true then there is no super-happy people, only people who are as happy as dead people (i.e. not suffering).

Extinction does not reduce human suffering at least as well as achieving an utopia would, it removes the humans who suffer.  

------------------------------- 

Satisfying needs quantifies an overall feeling of accomplishment (some basic needs like food which are necessary, some needs like internet which are not necessary to survive).  By ""quantifies"" I mean that, by your definitions, happiness is proportional to satisfied needs. 

For extinction to reduce suffering, it means that this quantified feeling is somehow improved, compared to now. For extinction to reduce suffering at least as well as a utopia, means that I can compare this overall feeling of accomplishment in satisfying my needs. 

But extinction does not reduce suffering, it removes suffering by removing needs. You can say that removing needs is equal to satisfying them (I have the need to eat, I built a system that keeps me alive without eating, the need of eating is satisfied) but without me being aware of that what you have achieved is not reducing suffering but removing the object which suffers.

In other words, suffering of a conscious being exists only if the conscious being exists as well. There is no suffering to be improved without something that suffers being aware of it. You remove the need to boil the water before making coffee by removing coffee.

388,t3_57ahdb,"Suffering is all relative - we may feel we are suffering greatly, and then with the experiences of someone who has overcome that suffering may look back at it as a positive experience, or look at a relative level of suffering which changes as things in one's life get better/worse.

I've 'suffered' boredom countless times memorizing new information or mastering a skill through repetition of something mindless, which left me needful of stimulation or excitation at the time only to grant me satisfaction(another need) later. 

So I guess my argument is twofold; firstly, a utopia would not actually relieve suffering of all kinds, since *relative* suffering is ultimately irreducible as it relies on a concept of 'normal' which is fluid; secondly, the potential satisfaction of suffering averted/overcome would disappear from humanity after genocide but not after utopia.

I might also point out that that there is a tremendous amount of trepidation, anxiety, heartbreak and despair that accompanies extinction which manifestly does *not* accompany utopia, and I feel your argument is thusly indefensible when you say that utopia would cause the same amount of suffering.

Let's step away from the sense in which your statement is necessarily true and turn towards a sense of human preferences we'll call Utility.

So from your post I would guess a simplified version of your argument would be that a person in non-existence would have no needs unfulfilled, and a person in a Utopia would have no needs or more than a person in non existence unfulfilled, therefore the Utility of not existing must be better than the Utility of living in a Utopia.

There is a firm split in the growing death literature between Robert Lanza and Thomas Ligotti on this issue. A myriad of other authors, including Mark Heisman and John(?) Mark would argue that consciousness is not the cause of violence but human bodies as conceptualize them now. This is why sexism, racism, all the -isms that are the root cause of violence materialize. 

Lanzas argument is that there is either an afterlife, or there is coming technology, namely transhumanism, that rids us of pain, suffering and the condition of humanity, while still maintaining consciousness.

If the issue is resolving human suffering, I argue that consciously having your needs met is a preferable state of being to not existing. If one ceases to exist, they don't know that their needs are or are not met, they are just in a neutral state of nothingness. This is not necessarily equivalent to a state of satisfaction. If you can have every need met all the time through some utopia, that would be a higher state of being than neutral nothingness.

In the world, people don't intentionally kill themselves when all of their needs are met, they kill themselves when they are at a low point in their life. That suggests that having needs met is preferential to not existing, which in turn is preferential to having no needs met. This implies that death is somewhere in ""the middle"" of desired states of being, and that existing allows people the potential to achieve a more desirable state at the risk of achieving a less desirable one.

What you are suggesting is that everyone should take the neutral option, which would keep everyone from the least desirable state, while also having the consequence of keeping everyone from the more desirable state.

In industrialized nations, overpopulation is effectively a non-issue. Most actually have a fertility rate well below the replacement rate; in some countries, like Japan and Italy, this is gradually becoming a demographic crisis. In countries with low birth rates, the high average age of the population means that eventually, there will not be a large enough working age population to support the post-working age population. This is already what would be the case in Europe if it weren't for immigration providing an influx of working-age people. Many governments have had to take action on this crisis, especially Japan, which has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, has a drastically decreasing population, and will have a majority of its population over 65 by 2060.

If nothing else, you are contributing your tendency or capability to evaluate advanced ethics to the general human genetic pool. Many people have kids without even asking such questions.

If you believe that you should not have biological offspring, then you must also accept  the premise that you are not a decent person or your offspring will not be. By the act of asking this question in ethical terms, you demonstrate to me that you are probably not a bad person, and therefore your offspring would offer more than average to the human species. 

Granted, it's not guaranteed that good people will not produce a psychopath, but we aren't talking about guarantees, as there are none.

Morality is a trick that some genes/species have evolved in order to gain an adaptive advantage, most likely by allowing them to live in societies.

Humans are by no means the only species to have evolved even what *humans* would recognize as morality. There's really nothing magic about it. It's purely a technique for propagating genes.

These habitats have taken since the formation of our planet to get to the state they're in now. One they're destroyed that's it, they're done, they're gone. There's no reversing that.

This is basically the same phenomenon that leads mono-culture farms to be highly susceptible to plague. With many different strains of crop, some small portion may be lost to disease on a regular basis and the bulk of the crop will still survive. With a mono-culture, any moderately successful disease has the potential to drive extinction. The most famous example of this is the probably the Gros Michel variety of banana, which went from the most commonly exported banana to all but extinct in less than a decade.

The loss of complexity in the biosphere (typically measured under the term ""biodiversity"") is extremely detrimental to the long-term health of the biosphere, on which we are reliant.

31,t3_701fav,"Look, I probably can't make a good argument to save my life, but this just makes me sad.

My POV is that it's not fair and it's very selfish to think this way. Planet Earth is probably all we have, since we haven't discovered a suitable successor and terraforming, at least for now, is out of the question. 

In my opinion, nature is amazing. It's a beautiful thing, and it's much, much more beautiful than most of the things we can do. Animals and other life forms outnumber us by a lot (iirc the total weight of all ants equals the total weight of all humans), but they're unfortunately much less powerful than we are. I see it as our responsibility to care for nature and our Earth, since right now, we are the single largest threat to nature, but we also have the power to not be this. I think that if we fail to preserve our planet, we've failed as a species. Imagine having to tell your descendants that we destroyed such a beautiful thing. If we can't save Earth, it would show how untrustworthy, and how selfish we are as a society. Which is almost as sad as seeing Earth die. 

In the grand scheme of things, life is something that transcends *Homo Sapiens*, and I don't think its fair to just fuck over millions of other life forms who're just trying to make a living.

15,t3_701fav,"There has been a really prevalent idea that has become associated with environmentalism which is a misrepresentation.

Really, environmentalism is about keeping the Earth from changing too drastically. Earth is an amazing place to live with all of environmental conditions necessary to support life as we know it. If we make massive changes to the Earth's environment, then humanity will suffer greatly because of it. The idea of colonizing Mars or another planet is *insanely* ambitious. If we try to colonize another planet before we can even effectively manage life and the climate of this one, we are going to be in for a really bad time.

10,t3_701fav,"Other than the simple survival of the species, there are several other good reasons for protecting nature.

Protecting nature gives us variety. When the environment changes rapidly, many species will undoubtedly die out, and it will take millions of years for new species to diverge.  As species die out due to rapid environmental change, the species who survive/thrive are the ones which are geared to adapt quickly. These tend to be the small animals such as insects and rodents.  

Most people enjoy seeing a variety of plants and animals. It's aesthetically pleasing. 

Beyond aesthetics, [nature is often the inspiration of our technology](https://cosmosmagazine.com/technology/10-technologies-inspired-nature). We find a chemical or adaptation which gives the organism an advantage in nature, and then we figure a way to copy that same advantage for humans. The less natural variety, the less this is possible. With each species extinct, we risk losing the cure for cancer forever.

Without variety in nature, the world would be less aesthetically pleasing and technological progress would be slowed.

There are also health considerations. We may survive as a species when the air is not breathable, but we will have health problems. Also, there are health problems we may not see coming, such as when we used to include lead in gasoline, and as a result, we were slowly killing all life on earth (including ourselves) via lead poisoning.

1-) Definitions can not be proven scientifically, as they are not empirical entities.

Thus, in their opinion, being gay is not natural.

To give an example combining both of these criticisms, you can argue that ""science has proven being gay is recognized in the nature"". But this is actually not true. First, while homosexual behavior is seen in animal kingdom, it is not decided whether there are animals that form exclusively same-sex partnerships. Many animals that show homosexual behavior also mate with opposite-sex and produce offsprings. Further, if the definition of homosexuality for animals is the same as for humans (i.e. attraction to same sex only), it is not possible to know if there are truly homosexual animals, as we can't measure attraction in animals, only mating-related behavior.

You'll need to decide if you agree with my definition of homosexuality, if you believe I correctly observed the sexual behavior of the animal, and if you believe I didn't somehow contaminate the experiment (for example, maybe bring in a zoo is what makes the penguins homosexual).

The problem is that people don't always say exactly what they mean in a way that makes sense to the person with whom they are communicating.

Unisex bathrooms are unappealing primarily for this reason. You should not be able to look above, below, or around the privacy barrier of a toilet. Period.

The bathrooms are all stalls, so there's no risk of being exposed to unwanted genitalia.

If physical force is an issue then you're going to have to have a strength test that won't let anyone in to the bathroom if someone physically weaker than them is already in there. There are strong women and there are weak men.

If perceived threat is the issue then you're going to have to run background checks on every person that enters the bathroom, and not let anyone with a criminal history of violence

That said, the unisex-for-all has several advantages I would like to suggest:

- Will break down cultural stigma over a generation or two (no immediate help, granted, but maybe future generations could benefit the same as we look back on past anachronisms).
- Will equalize treatment of the sexes (excepting urinals) where regardless of gender (birth or identity), the same queue exists for all.
- Will allow positive bystander effects as well as negative ones (e.g. you will increase the likelihood of encountering people who won't stand for other people being bullied).

I'm from Wellington, New Zealand. The city council converted all public bathrooms to unisex over the last five or six years and there are no longer any 'old style' segregated bathrooms anymore.  
What you're missing from the unisex bathroom conversation is this:  
They are singular facilities.

They would be separated but not by gender, but it would say if it has a urinal or a toilet. Urinals would be used by biosex males to pee, and the toilets for every other case, and anyone can choose any of the toilets

The discussion is now ""where do we wash our hands?"" I think we can have 'neutral' common handwashing places for everyone, some restaurants have that here in Argentina, and everyone seems to be OK with it, maybe it's weird in USA

If we have safety problems and harassment in this neutral washing hand places like you say, then we would have to put a mirror and a handwasher in every individual restroom, but I don't think this would be necessary, and honestly I don't think people care who they wash their hands next to.

There is no immediate solution it's getting to the place where Trans people are just going to be seen as another aspect of our society. This conversation is exposing someone to the normality of trans people who could've otherwise lived their life not thinking of.

There's a common illusion at work here. The illusion that nobody ever changes their mind on the internet. When really people just rarely ever admit to their opponent that their minds have been changed. The people I argued with about religion have absolutely no clue what an impact they had on my worldview in both the short and long term.  They probably came away thinking their efforts had been in vain. Because I was much too proud to say that I was wrong. And I was also fighting an internal battle as well. I had been convinced but my emotions were still trying to fight with my mind.

I think it's a funny kind of arrogance that you see here and elsewhere on reddit. Subscribers to this premise are basically saying,  ""well, I may have the capacity and wisdom to change my mind in light of evidence and reason but trying to convince other people is just pointless.""

If you need proof that minds can change, look no further than the rise of atheism/agnosticism since the invention of the internet. That's what happens when people have an anonymous outlet for debate and discussion where they can talk about these things with no risk to their reputation or social standing.

570,t3_44w1wn,"First off I don't agree with a bunch of Bernie Sander's economic policies. However I think your arguments against them are not great.

- Even under Bernie Sander's tax plan, the wealthy will still make a significant amount of income. Furthermore the more money they make before taxes, the more they will have after taxes, so they will still have profit motive. (Albeit not as high as before.) They are still allowed to make money, as they deserve.

- The economy is not a zero-sum game. There are not a fixed number of jobs available for any given degree. Lifting others up does not mean others have to sink. Also improving the overall education of the population is a net positive. Complaining that your education will be relatively less valuable is ironically pretty selfish. It'd be like a high school graduate complaining about free government-funded high schools.

- I think you are confusing marginal and average tax rates. A family making $250,000 wouldn't have to pay 50% on all their income, only on additional income. Many places have a top marginal income tax rate of 50% and wealthy families are not ""shredded"" by them.

563,t3_44w1wn,"&gt;Like the title says, I think that most Bernie supporters are selfish and want to live in some dreamworld without caring at all about, or very well even realizing, what it's costing *everyone*.

Arguably just as important as what it costs everyone is what it would save everyone.

Medical costs are the single biggest cause of bankruptcy in the US.  Universal HealthCare would eliminate that

Low-wage workers rely on government support programs, which are paid for by taxpayers. So taxpayers are subsidizing the low wage. A higher minimum wage would level that out

&gt;The majority of Bernie supporters are young, in their early-mid 20s. I am 24 years old myself. The vast majority of young adults my age do not make a lot of money. Because of this, why would they give a shit about tax brackets? 

I'm 24, currently in a STEM position, already well into the 28% tax bracket. I have no student loan debt, company-sponsored healthcare, and a small-but-growing amount of investments. When I support Bernie, it's not for personal gain, but for the benefit that I believe he'll bring to this country and the people in it

&gt;Households that make $250,000+ stand to get shredded by these tax rates. It doesn't matter if they can afford it. They shouldn't have to give away half of their household income. 

Marginal tax rate means that to actually end up giving away half of your income in income taxes, your salary would need to be well above $250k. If you're making above $250k and not expecting to see your tax rate increase, then you're living in your own version of a dreamworld.

Some people become poor by risking everything. Are they pieces of shit? What makes the people who ended up successful any more special? 

&gt;They shouldn't have to give away half of their household income. Yes, half.

So I see from other comments that you do actually understand how marginal tax rates work so this statement is misleading. Even if the top marginal tax rate was 50%, you would have to make about $10 million per year before your income was effectively halved. People at that level probably make much of their money from capital gains which is taxed differently. Not to mention all the write-offs and loopholes they benefit from.

&gt;Asking for Bernie's student debt forgiveness is a short-sighted, quick fix that you want because you're feeling the pressure of student loans on your bank account. Again, don't be selfish.

He's not advocating forgiveness of student loans across the board. From what I can find it seems that he may be saying that loan forgiveness might be appropriate in some rare cases. More importantly his  plan is to reduce interest rates on student loans and to make the *first two years of community college* free. 

&gt;But if my degree was included with my parent's taxes, the demand for my skills would be lower.

It simply allows smart, hardworking people who otherwise couldn't not afford higher education to get educated in a field of their choosing. If anything, increasing the amount of people who are able to go to college would increase competion. This would cause getting into a good program to be more impressive than otherwise.

Likewise, most Bernie Sanders' supporters don't want everyone to make the same wage. Innovators, business owners and employees that have large stress/workload demands will still get paid significantly more than the unskilled worker. However, by narrowing this gap you open the options for many hardworking people to succeed. That person who works two jobs to stay afloat and cant afford the money nor time to get a degree in their passion might be able to quit one job to go back to school part time. Those families who weren't fortunate enough to come from a rich past wont have to worry as much about if they can pay their rent or if they can give their children a childhood they think they deserve. Plus they would be able to spend more money which would be reinvested in the economy.

I think the reason that the younger generation speaks the loudest in a need for change is because they are firsthand experiencing these struggles that their parents and especially their grandparents never had to contend with on this scale.

   The moment you bring ego gender into it, you're contributing to the problem that started the inequality and distress. It's two sides of the same coin.

* Double standard regarding alcohol and sex (there was a case at a university where a drunk boy and a drunk girl had sex, and only the man was expelled from school)

* Affirmative consent laws - basically making men liable of rape in every sexual encounter. Some feminists are trying to classify a man saying ""hi"" to a woman on the street as sexual harassment (see that viral Youtube video of 10 hours of walking in NYC as a woman)

* Men being guilty until proven innocent by the public in rape accusations. False rape accusers aren't punished, and the mere questioning of the legitimacy of the accusation makes you a ""victim blamer"". All this despite the endless barrage of high-profile cases like Columbia Mattress girl, UVA ""gang rape"", Duke ""gang rape"", Palentir CEO's psycho ex-girlfriend, and Eric Frimpong that've ruined innocent men's lives.

The thing with TRP or any ideologically charged community is that there is enough thing a happening around the world that, if you dig enough you can almost always find examples that either support or refute the ideology. TRP, for the most part engages with this; they sit around and share stories about women being abusive, women being petty, stacked courts, etc and use these stories as ""proof"" that we live in a society that is hostile to men. The inconsistencies of these accounts and counter-evidence is surpressed with a conspirational view of feminism and women; for example in TRP, most rape accusations or abuse accusations are ""really"" just women gaming the system, and if they are successful it's because of a matriarchal conspiracy keeping men down, etc etc

In the TRP environment, you will never encounter evidence, stories or ideas that run against the overall narrative (that society is stacked against men) and as a result, the more you will come to see the TRP perspective as the only perspective, because most of your information will be coming from a TRP background.

The first sounds worse because we assume that a man with some power in the relationship will abuse his power, but we don't assume the same for women.

I don't think this holds. Generally when I hear men say their wife dresses them, it's in the context of ""I can't be bothered to understand fashion, so I just defer to my wife's fashion sense."" That's very different than a woman who actually has opinions on what she wants to wear, but is disallowed by a controlling husband.

812,t3_4c4ypf,"I am not sure that I want to challenge your particular points, but I do want to challenge your conclusion

From reading the studies, I think that men experience a significant amount of gender stereotyping and discrimination, and that this receives much less airtime or consideration than what women undergo.  I don't know that I want to compare the discrimination and stereotyping that me  or women face, since I think it's hard to quantify and I'm not sure it matters.

I think where I branched away from TRP and MRA was in the solution. Just because men face problems doesn't invalidate the ones that women face. Most feminists (a common target) are more interested in pushing for lifting up women than bringing down men (with some and notable exceptions). I don't think feminism will fix those problems, so men need their own movement to remove their stereotype and work on discrimination and false perceptions. But it shouldn't be one that is antagonistic towards feminism or women.

A lot of the sexism I see from TRP I think comes from a place of hurt.  When you face these types of problems and nobody even acknowledges them, it's natural to hurt and lash out. I imagine many groups have felt the same way over history. Much of the sexism from feminists comes from a similar place. We need to learn to work together, not draw more artificial divides between us.

Because that statement is retarded, to be blunt. You're removing the fact that he is tall, has great cheekbones, plays for the local football team, travels the world, etc and just leaving his bad attitude. In the wild, this guy is perfect as he has great genes and strong enough to protect his kin, and so women are attracted to him while their brain is overridden by their heart. 

These 'just a nice guy' s are also almost always in their teenage years or in their early 20s, an age period where a lot of attractive women want to have fun and meet some hot guys and have an exciting fling for a few months, not settle down with a guy who will do her taxes for her. 

These nice guys are also often ignoring their own unattractive qualities - sure you claim you're 'a nice guy' but you can be possessive, clingy, smother her with affection, be unfit etc.

Honestly, i used to be one of these guys but i realised I'm short, underweight, overly competitive, don't do enough non computer activities etc and worked on improving myself rather than blaming women for my shortcomings.

For instance, I am inclined to think that the higher rate of suicide among men is in SOME cases because men are not taught to talk about their emotions enough. Therefore us girls need to be aware of that, and make our loved ones and our male friends know that they can talk to us and trust us. We need to raise our sons to be emotionally open people, and not to think that ""boys don't cry"". This is only one example. 

These are things we don't need to do as part of a movement. We can address these issues at home, and encourage our female friends to see our point of view.

The medical literature is unequivocal that light drinking improves well being and moderate drinking may as well. Heavy drinking however, is known to cause liver problems and death and is indisputably associated with higher mortality 

Your drinking is fine but you just need to cut down to light/moderate levels. If you could get it down to a drink or two per day, you should be gold. Experiment with tapering perhaps.

From my experience of [way too much] social drinking, in the long run it'll leave you empty and 5-10 years down the road you'll try to figure out what you have to show for your time. With nothing coming to mind, you might turn back to the only thing that never let you down, alcohol. Endless loop that leads to.....

Here's my suggestion, when it gets to be too much, exercise. Punch a punching bag or ride your bike. By the end you'll work off a ton of stress, release a shitload of endorphins, and have nothing in your brain but how your muscles hurt. Plus in the long run you're getting fit for the next girl and/or all those cute tinderellas out there! Instead of running through your liver like it's on sale, you'll actually be getting healthier.

At the end of the day I'm just suggesting to find distractions besides only booze; booze is fun and all, but you should only use it when you're in a good mindset. Exercise is the best IMO, but if that's not you join a club or something. The worst thing is to just sit around thinking about how much life sucks; that's an endless rabbit hole (see video below).

You're not the first person in humanity's history to experience the freedom from self alcohol temporarily grants us. You're not unique. Continue down this path and your journey will end like everyone else who has done this before you, either in misery, death or institutions.

Money spent on alcohol may be cheaper than therapy, but the cost of down time being drunk and incapable of growth, career wise or otherwise, far outweighs the benefits of choosing perpetual intoxication over a sober life.

The relief alcohol provides is fickle. You talk about dopamine being released while drinking but fail to acknowledge cortisol and other metabolic and hormonal chemicals that completely screw you up when out of balance, particularly when that imbalance comes from substance abuse. 

Perpetual intoxication is a full time job. Alcoholics and other addicts can't keep jobs. 

The peace you seek will not be found in perpetual intoxication, because perpetual intoxication is a myth. You gotta come down sometime...and then you'll just be stuck with yourself again. Why not address the issue first? That way when you come down, you're ok with what you come back to. 

Hell is real and it lives at the bottom of a bottle.

All of this is experiential. You don't understand what the path you've chosen leads to. You'll go down it because you are me. Just remember that because of that, there's hope and unconditional acceptance to be found. Sobriety bests all intoxication and you can have it too.

The second thing is that heavy drinking is like being in love, it's great in the beginning and shitty afterwards, you should know that because you used to drink heavily in the past. It either loses its appeal and becomes boring or becomes a joyless addiction.

I'm not going to tell you to stop drinking or cut back drastically. But if you drink more than you are now you will eventually regret it. And cutting back your drinking is a lot fucking harder than never drinking that heavily in the first place.

So, regardless of how confident you feel about your future, it's possible that your life (dating, job, social life, how you feel) will get better. Other folks have pretty well covered the evidence that heavy alcohol use leads to diminishing returns, mood-wise.

On treatment, there are some amazing treatments that do wonders.  There are anti-anxiety meds that give the same relaxing type relief that alcohol does without all the side effects.  There are anti-depressants that give a bit of a different type of relief, but can yield the same result. They take the edge off pain or stress.

Drinking is awesome. There are great beers, wines, and liquors to try before your life is over.

You don't even need other people for those things if you don't want!

You don't want to believe in hope or success? Alcohol won't give you the choice. It isn't there to enlighten you, it isn't there to make you happy, it is there to make everything else seem sad. It is a depressant. It will continue this cycle of dependence until it kills you if you let it.

You justify all this with a pessimistic worldview that basically amounts to 'the real world sucked anyway'.

Here is the 'limit'.  I dont drink at all anymore because I dont like it anymore.  The hangovers become more destructive in your 40's.  Your liver cant take it.

A 13-14 year old girl willingly has sex with a 30 year old man. Did she give consent? I suppose, but was she raped? absolutely! That is textbook statutory rape. Why though? 
It's because society as deemed the decisions of minors to engage in sexual acts as not legally binding. We do not consider the brains of minors to be capable of making a fully informed rational decision and therefore the decision to engage in intercourse is judged to be entirely that of the 30 year old man, in the eyes of the law the man agreed to sex, the girl couldn't, hence the man is considered to have raped her. 

Now let me draw comparisons between this case and that of an intoxicated woman who is of age. 
While intoxicated you are incapable of making fully informed, educated, rational decisions. Therefore by the same logic that makes statutory rape illegal we must also draw the conclusion that anyone who is mentally impaired cannot consent to sex with another person and that only the man in our scenario consented to sex, ergo: rape. 

You made the case of you being responsible for your actions in the scenario where you assault or murder someone while intoxicated, this is irrelevant because those are acts of aggression which one would argue are never rational be it sober or not.

918,t3_4xcsiu,"&gt;If someone gets super drunk and rapes a girl then he is responsible (he still raped her) and if someone gets super drunk and gives consent then they are responsible (they still gave consent).

You've described two scenarios that both make sense on the face of it - but it seems pretty clear to me that there are other important scenarios to consider.

In particular, there's the case of a person who is so drunk that no reasonable person would consider them capable of understanding what they were consenting to.  So while they might say ""yes"" when propositioned for sex, they might also say ""yes"" when propositioned for a long jump off the edge of a cliff, and they clearly don't understand what they're saying yes to.  

I would consider sex between such a person and a reasonably sober person rape, and I think you would too at some level of intoxication somewhere between ""super drunk"" and ""incapacitated"".

It's more complicated if both people are intoxicated or otherwise impaired, as the mens rea (guilty mind; the perpetrator's understanding of what they are doing) quickly becomes fuzzy if neither person is capable of discerning that the consent is no good.",d6ecz73,"CMV: If a woman gives consent while drunk, she still gave consent",1467,1,588,2022-05-13T13:19:50.871398Z,2022-05-13T13:19:50.871398Z,147.368,Crime and punishment

Do you think it would or should be any different if a man gives consent while drunk?  I guess I don't understand why you focus only on women in your initial post and many of your replies.
  
For the record, I am a woman who refrains from getting absolutely drunk because I do not want to enter a state where my judgment would be impaired and I might do things that sober me would consider wrong.  But I am not sure that a general obligation exists to behave this way.  It seems to me much more the case that people are morally obliged to refrain from taking advantage of vulnerable people than people are obliged to never become vulnerable.  For example, a mugger is responsible for mugging their victim, even if said victim takes an unadvisedly unsafe route when walking home, or walks home drunk and thus isn't in a great position to defend themselves.  Probably a different choice on the part of the victim would have prevented the outcome of being robbed, but the mugger is still the one responsible.",d6ejoyn,"CMV: If a woman gives consent while drunk, she still gave consent",1483,1,604,2022-05-13T14:24:31.741937Z,2022-05-13T14:24:31.741937Z,22.285,Crime and punishment

I mean think about it, protecting the vulnerable is a really common value. It's in every major religion. It's in basically every legal system.

Following this if someone is so drunk that they also cannot fully understand what they are consenting too then the same argument applies. To allow certain rules to have loopholes in certain situations would create an incredibly slippery slope. For example if somebody got into a car crash, that was entirely their fault and received a brain injury that left them with the brain of a 5 year old, then surely we would not allow them consenting to sex as a defence to rape, as they could not properly rationalise the situation. As with your example this again is someone putting themselves in a situation and making a bad decision, however this should not serve as a bar to conviction.

1 - the person needs to be able to understand all the information relevant to the decision they are making.

3 - they must be capable of weighing up the pros and cons of the decision and make an informed choice.

4 - they need to be able to communicate this choice.

Determining the appropriateness of a sexual act is always centered around the power dynamic. Is one party in vastly greater control of the situation than the other? If so, then the sex act was inappropriate and criminal. If not, then it's ok.

So let's run through some scenarios:

Adult with child. Adult is in much more control over the situation than the child, therefore it's wrong.

Teenager with younger child. The teenager is in more control over the situation than the child, therefore it's wrong.

Two younger children. Depends on the situation, but again, the power dynamic is what's important. If it's two children innocently experimenting, we typically don't judge it as wrong to the level of criminal. It is simply something that can be handled by talking to the children involved.

Two consenting adults. Both adults in relatively equal control over the situation, therefore, it's okay.

Drunk adult with sober adult. The sober adult is in much greater control over the situation than the drunk adult. Therefore it's wrong.

Two drunk adults. The control is close to equal. Therefore it's okay.

563,t3_4x7vi8,"Justice has multiple goals: sequestration, rehabilitation, and retribution.

Sequestration from society is necessary to protect others from the harmful individual. If you break the rules, you no longer get the chance to break them again. Murderers can't murder again, thieves can't steal again. This still makes sense as a practical necessity in a universe without free will.

Rehabilitation is the next step. Ideally, while sequestered, you should be taught skills that will prevent you from performing crimes in the future. Even in a universe without free will, nurture still plays a powerful role in shaping our destinies. Genetics aren't everything. We can still direct our population down paths that will be more socially beneficial.

However, the last aspect of justice, retribution, will no longer be necessary. Humiliation and punishment will be recognized as the pure emotional catharsis that it is; it is not holy or righteous or pure to take pleasure in another's suffering, no matter how ""evil"" or ""deserving"" that person seems to be. In a world without free will, we would have to recognize that our society somehow played a role in the creation of such an individual, and as such it is our responsibility to sequester and rehabilitate where possible.

This is true whether things are deterministic or not. 

A justice system adds a *cost* to the ""social behavior"" side of the matrix, making it again a rational choice to behave appropriately, because of the cost of punishment.

Again, this is true whether or not things are completely deterministic, and/or whether or not that implies we have no ""free will"", whatever that term actually means... it's pretty incoherent. Compatiblists define ""free will"" in such a way as to be completely compatible with determinism in order to rephrase this point.

The first being that it is a system which is the necessary corollary to any government based upon a body of Laws. The Justice system is not about Justice, it is about enforcement of Laws, regardless of whether or not they are Just.

The second is that the existence of penalties acts as a deterrent, regardless of Free Will. The goal is to minimize the violation of laws, and the existence of a formalized, relatively consistent system of enforcement and punishment does dissuade people from breaking laws, or at least from behaving in such a reckless manner that they get caught.

And the final reason is that it serves to segregate those who have broken the Law from regular citizenry in a manner that makes their Will and its violent or destructive expression irrelevant to the general populace, regardless of its Freedom.

In my opinion, the question of Free Will is actually a pretty nebulous and useless question. We are complex biological creatures. Our motivations and actions are determined by a multitude of factors beyond our conscious control. Even our consciousness is, barring a supernatural element, the experiential expression of our underlying biological self. Our Will is effected by internal and external circumstances, and much like an equation resolving down to a solution, we resolve upon a course of action.

The thing is that these desires take a lot into account.

(the desire to lose weight and the desire to have money for other things) And how heavy those categories weigh depends on the importance a person gives to those categories. 

So in the case of a justice system, it comes into consideration, it is like the calories and price, an negative consequence of a criminal act. Your subconscious will take it into account and therefore there is a need for punishment, because the justice system existing does diminish the amounts of crimes committed. 

Also you need to understand that the justice system has more utility than just punishing the criminal, it also protects society from criminals by locking them up.

This is actually an ethical issue I've also discussed before, and it's an interesting thought experiment.

Your basic premise is that we currently punish people who choose to commit a crime, which is why autonomous actions, intoxication, and other situations where choices has been removed are defenses to many crimes, and if free will doesn't exist it isn't a choice.

But we can square those concepts in two ways:

(1). The only part of philosophy about criminal law is affected by a lack of free will is the retributive part; the part actually about punishing someone for the wrongs they chose to do. The utilitarian aspect is strengthened, as the purpose of punishment for criminal action is to create a deterrence. Under a deterministic outlook, that deterrence would be the primary goal of law enforcement. We punish so that (a) this individual will be less likely to reoffend, and (b) others are more likely not to commit that crime.

(2). Determinism does not mean there is no decisionmaking. It just means that the decisionmaking is not subject to some overriding conscious choice. But if we accept that people are incredibly complex computers, our focus is on reprogramming them (Orwellian as that may sound). As above, that means trying to change their future decisionmaking, but the consequences can flow in the same way that if you released a website that isn't working, first you would take it down for a period of time to try to fix it with as little downtime as possible, then using more and more downtime until (either because the page does something really godawful, or its irreparable) you either keep the page down indefinitely or delete it.",d6d9npa,"CMV: If free will doesn't exist, the justice system is fundamentally unjust",1786,1,907,2022-05-15T16:22:45.807311Z,2022-05-15T16:22:45.807311Z,6.926,Morality

for him, moral responsibility hinges on the generalized abilities that make a person competent or incompetent in what ever category they are being assessed. there's more to his compatiblist position than that, but really all i have to argue is that there are more categories than just the 'moral responsibility' one that are worth considering when convicting someone. others have pointed toward a consequentialist justification for locking people up based on the likelihood that they will act in such a way again (or in signaling a warning/deterrent to society). afterall, ""locking people up"" does not by necessity include in itself any moral condemnation - it could solely be for preventative purposes. 

i agree with sam harris on this point- that if there was a pill to uncontroversially transform criminals or harmful psychopaths into normal productive members of society, that we should give it to them the way we give medicine to someone whos sick, and that opting out of giving the pill and instead continuing to punish them for their misdeeds would be senseless in such a case.

1152,t3_4pbwvb,"*Terrorism* defined by wikipedia is violence with the a political, religious, or ideological aim. is the Terror implies an ideology as a motivation, rather than senseless killing for the sake of attention or being mentally ill.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism

Examples of terrorist mass shooters:

-Dylan Roof (shot up a black church because of his racist ideology)

-Omar Mateen (shot up a gay nightclub because of his ideology)

-Anders Behring Breivik (shot up a camp because of his ideology)

Examples of mass shooters that shouldn't be considered terrorists since their motivation was not from their ideology:

-The Columbine shooters (shot up their school because they wanted attention + wanted revenge on classmates)

-The movie theater shooter (shot up a theater because he wanted attention)

-Sandy Hook shooter (shot up a school because of his mental illness + wanting attention)

-Dallas Tower shooter (shot from a tower because of a brain tumor)

If they are *white* and are committing violence because of their ideology, they are terrorists. If they are not, they shouldn't be considered terrorists. Otherwise, all mass shootings would be terrorism, and if your example of killing a single MP officer is an example of terrorism, then we've created the tautology: all shootings, whether you kill a single person or many, are terrorism.

&gt;Where do we draw the line between ""disturbed mental patient"" and ""terrorist""?

The line is exactly where it always has been - if they are using fear to push an agenda, they are a terrorist.

&gt;Roof later confessed that he committed the shooting in hopes of igniting a race war.

That means he's technically a terrorist, too, since he is trying to push an anti-black agenda.

However, I feel that as of late the usage of the word 'terrorist' has grown to imply association with a terrorist group. If the Charleston shooter were a member of the KKK, and the KKK regularly committed acts of terror (they don't actually do that nowadays AFAIK, but it's the closest thing I can come up with), then the media would call him a terrorist too.

Calling what the Pulse shooter did 'Islamic terrorism' is as accurate as calling the Charleston shooter 'racist terrorism'. The only reason the Charleston shooter isn't labeled a terrorist is because there is no racist anti-black terrorist group with an agenda that he could have claimed to have been pushing.

Basically, you're seeing racism where there isn't any. If you can find a group of white people with a codified agenda who are committing violence in the name of that agenda, and yet not being called terrorists, then I will grant you that there is hypocrisy.

What would make you think this?

On a different but similar level: Police.

The police force enforce an aspect of the will of the government, which stands behind the laws we've made. Police make communities safer from obvious crime with their presence or by taking action against criminals. So that is their purpose. To enforce and protect the law.

The army has a similar but different function. Armies defend nations, and also carry out the will of their government, defending the resources the country relies on or securing border lines, passage routes, everything that enables stable development.

MY POINT: Without an army, the government will still need to TAKE ACTION to ensure the citizens/communities are safe and provided for. If there was no army, this would fall on to the police forces in the communities, because people/companies/governments still want stuff. Essentially, you would still need an army to function as a country, or form alliances with someone who has one. Trade is the ONLY other way we can overcome this, by increasing access to resources for everyone and reducing the effectiveness of an army over time. The army was necessary to ensure the resources were secure initially but trade can overcome it.

Can the blame really be put on a soldier for this? The need is created by the system we have in place. The need will be there until it's no longer needed. Unless you're willing to argue that it is in the best interest for poor people to want to die or suffer rather than join the army?

Your view is one of many in a greater debate about the fundamental nature of mankind: If civilization were removed - with its national pride and drive for resources taken with it - would mankind be peaceful, or violent? 

Unfortunately, the question itself is moot; whether or not mankind as a whole were peaceful is irrelevant because there only needs to be violent individuals, few and far between, to trigger cycles of violence. These violent individuals will have to be met with violence in order to insure the survival of the whole. One this has happened, it is no longer just these individuals who must be considered violent; it is the home. TL;DR: Humans are violent.

So, if country A does not have a military, only police, and country B *does* have a military, country B *will* exploit the situation. History shows this happens time and time again. Until a global order is established, countries will compete for resources. This competition sometimes delves into violence, because that is a fundamental aspect of our species. Hopefully, we will eventually evolve out of it. In the meantime, we have not, and war is guaranteed to exist somewhere in the world.  

Following this model, volunteering to serve doesn't make you a perpetrator of war - only a participant in something that would be happening whether you were there or not.

1) Economic reason: So as far as, there is money &amp; job security involved, There will be people who are willing to join it

2) Seeking recognition: This exists bec most govt projects armed forces as very important &amp; respectful entity via media, movies etc. So for many people, recognition is also a big motivation

Now knowing that not all men are born equal, some will be stronger than others. This leads to cooperation between men to create a greater force to defend against a larger threat. Essentially there is power in numbers.  

Apply this to international relations and you see the same thing. Countries are only as strong as what they can defend against. Their resources, wealth, security are all not implicitly assured, it needs to be able to protect it, either through military strength or strategic alliances with other countries.  

If your argument was there should be no war or aggression between men, I would wholeheatedly agree, but on a global level, we are still in the state of nature i mentioned earlier. In this world there will always be someone who tries to assert dominance or control over others, and is also reflected in global politics.

There are large branches of geometry, known as [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry), that are based on replacing one of the five axioms.  Once you have chosen a new set of axioms, you can start proving new theorems based on the new axioms.

When creating a system of mathematics, you are free to choose whatever axioms you desire, without restriction.  In this way, I would say that systems of mathematics are invented.

People have shared meaning because we share certain things - drives, desires, purposes that we all cannot avoid having.

We can now categorize other stars and recognize that the sun is one because it's become useful to do a certain kind of scientific investigation that tries to go beyond this kind of categorization by meaning, but the sun is still otherwise treated and noted as special and distinct to us because it affects us differently.

We could look at math ~similarly with this in mind, you really couldn't get the same kind of math if when you chopped a piece of food in half to share with your fellow man the result was four times as much food. It was discovered because the way you can divide things up is seemingly there as a limited set of possible outcomes before people interact with it. The outcomes are discovered, at least.

Muslim immigrants are changing every society that takes them in large numbers.

Of course they are. Whether that change is for the better or not is a value judgment.

I realise this is a side issue to your main question, but you're suggesting that refugees are OK but economic migrants aren't, which is at best simplistic. A refugee is just someone who's been granted asylum whereas 'economic migrants' is just a blanket term for anyone who's migrated anywhere hoping for a better standard of living. That doesn't make them some kind of grasping plague of locusts, it just means that they haven't officially applied for asylum. 

If civil war has reduced you to begging for food out of the rubble of your former home to feed your children, with no heating and temperatures dropping below freezing at night, then I think any sane person would try to find a better life for themselves. You wouldn't use the people traffickers crossing the Mediterranean in suicidal conditions unless you were truly desperate.

I don't know where you're from OP, but here in the UK there is often a kind of sneer that goes alongside 'economic migrant' as if to suggest they're just greedy for some kind of charmed life living off government handouts, whereas actually these are usually desperate people whose lives have been completely destroyed through no fault of their own.

1. I once saw this quote on reddit ""You know what the problem is with being an economist? Everyone has an opinion about the economy. No body goes up to a geologist and says, 'Igneous rocks are fucking bullshit.'""
People tend to have opinions on basic economic issues that are not up for debate. For example, Trump and his supporters are against free trade, despite the fact that it has had unanimous support from economists. This is the first reason to learn about economics, understanding important concepts, graphs, and trends will help you weed through what is obviously bullshit in the national discussion.

2. Some stuff is disagreed upon by economists. However, many economists develop their stance due to implicit and confirmation biases. Supply siders are often- not by coincidence- lifelong conservatives who hold conservative values. It is important to have a knowledge of economics in order to determine what the data says rather than what people's opinions are. For example, if you learn that trickle down economics is not based in fact, you can form an opinion on what the marginal tax rate should be based on your values, rather than based on the idea that a lower marginal rate will help the poor. 

3. You talk about being right in regards to foreign policy and economics, which is only the case when something is universally or overwhelmingly beneficial to everyone. For example, you can be right about the Iraq War or Free Trade, but you can't be right about what how much we should tax the rich.

This is a very dangerous error to make.

These ""experts"" you look to, i.e. economists and political scientists, rarely if ever test their theories and hypotheses with randomized controlled experiments. Not because they are evil, but because these tests are typically economically and politically impossible.

Unfortunately, the iteration of generating hypotheses and testing them through rigorous experimentation is the only somewhat reliable way we know to produce knowledge of causal effects.

If an analysts makes a claim of the sort, policy A would cause effects B, C and D, that claim amounts to a causal assertion. The final authority on the truth of which is always rigorous experiment - not consensus of any social group, no matter what their job title. 

If you have spare time to inform yourself of anything, I recommend epistemology and the philosophy of science. Once you know how to reliably produce knowledge, then you can take a look at the methods used by the people you revere as experts. I think you will find in many cases that it amounts to fancy statistical speculation rather than science.

Professions are much like religions in that they are social groups bound together by ideas. You wouldn't take consensus among Mormons on their doctrine as evidence for the validity of the doctrine. Apply the same logic to the professions. 

The greatest idea in science is that the final authority on truth is the result of experiment - not the opinion of the researcher.

Neither side can *prove* their position correct, and both sides will build upon this central concept to define their positions on other matters.

The reality is that while the goal of universities *is* to teach and to further our knowledge, universities are institutions attended by thousands of people, and people have needs. A university that spends no resources on the wellbeing of its students is not a good institution, regardless of how high it may stand academically. 

Safe spaces are a lot more situational and constrained than you seem to think. A safe space is a place where, in the presence of people who share your experiences, you can let go of the facade you hold on front of others and discuss difficult and sensitive topics without fear of being judged. Having this option helps thousands of students to get by everyday. Think of support groups for victims of an accident or crime; this is the same thing. When the session is over, the students put their armour back on and go back to facing the outside world. 

Everyone has sensibilities. And everyone must learn to get through everyday life in spite of these weaknesses and sensibilities. The thing is, if you never discuss them or find a a group of supporting peers to help you through, then you likely won't be able to function very well.

Most people work and live around people with similar attitudes as they, and if they do encounter other opinions, they have no real reason to confront them, and those opinions aren't usually very thorough. 

Only on college campuses do you find the entire range of opinions, and you find them thoroughly fleshed out. That's because these kids care more, and go out of their way to figure out all of the details.

The reason that this becomes an issue and is noticed by anyone is *because* of all of the differing opinions. If they weren't being challenged to begin with, it never would have became an issue. Other groups don't find this kind of challenge, so it never becomes an issue.

Conservatives believe in a smaller government, which naturally means fewer government programs. This might sound bad at first, but let me ask you: have you ever known the government to be good at handling money? I barely trust them with my tax dollars to get things done. 

One thing most liberals fail to grasp about conservatives is we're not specifically against freedom and liberty for all. Quite the opposite. You're in control of your own destiny, and the options might not necessarily be clear if someone isn't in a great situation, but they're there. 

Let's take for example a couple lives on minimum wage working at walmart to support their family. Both husband and wife make whatever minimum wage is in their hypothetical town barely making ends meet. They feel stuck. But they're not stuck. They've just been conditioned to accept that they'll never get anywhere and THAT is the problem. Hypothetical family has every right to just go door to door and offer to do something like mowing the lawn for the neighborhood and make way more than minimum wage. Chances are, most families are willing to give 20$ to mow a lawn. 

Anyways that's my rant. Conditioning the unfortunate into thinking they're stuck is the major problem in this country, not specifically liberals or conservatives.

I’m not saying that there shouldn’t be a minimum wage, just that a minimum wage at $15 likely is too high. A recent [study from the University of Washington](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/02/seattles-minimum-wage-hike-may-have-cut-wages-and-jobs-study-author.html) found that low wage workers lost an average of $125 a month when the minimum wage was increased from $11 to $13 dollars an hour (although an earlier raise from $10 to $11 actually increased their earnings). Employers reacted by cutting hours and jobs, so the average low income worker was worse off. Now any policy that hurts the poor, I'd argue is counter productive and wrong. 

It's hard to apply this to the national level and there have been other studies that found contradictory results, but there is substantial evidence that conservative’s opposition to a $15 minimum wage may be better off for the working poor. More “conservative” policies like the earned income tax credit or universal basic income might be more effective at boosting wages for the working poor, but now I’m definitely getting into economics.

You're describing social conservatives as only slowing down positive change to a pace that the general public can tolerate.  But social conservatives also try to keep negative change from happening because social progressives take it too far.  

For example, it is good to fight against white people being racist against black people.  But it is not a good solution to institutionalize racism going the other way, like in the case of affirmative action.

It is good to fight against discrimination against LBGT people.  But it is not a good solution to take away someone's freedom to decide who they do business with, like in the case of requiring a baker to bake a cake for a gay wedding.  (In fact, it runs counter to American values like freedom and liberty for all).

It is good to have all sides presented when faced with controversial issues of public importance.

The 1917 revolution in Russia is such an example. The new values for Marxism falsely promised prosperity and fairness. And while we often think of this movement in terms of an economic system, it certainly had social values which were considered progressive, particularly a progression away from God. Social conservatives were a brake to that movement.

In other example, social conservatives tend to defend marriage as an institution b/w one man and one woman. Informed conservatives know that this gives children the best chance to start life either in the middle class or in the lower class on a trajectory into the middle class. The Brookings Institute has plenty of evidence for this on their website.  Marriage really is a key issue in fighting poverty. Progressives tend to devolve marriage into a human invention malleable to the will of the masses without really considering what effects will come 2-3 generations down the road.

1049,t3_4dat5a,"I think the issue with your argument is that you treat the domain of human knowledge as expanding and building on itself, while the process of acquiring that knowledge as immutable. Remember that education is a field that is also being actively researched as of late. Having been through the public education system I would argue that the majority of student time is spent performing useless tasks that ultimately did not contribute to their understanding of some crucial subject matter. Already, the rise of the internet has made a huge difference in dropping the learning curve for some serious subject matter. This has made it possible for teenagers to make it to Silicon Valley, and ingenuity to come from unlikely places. There is still a huge room for advancement in the fields of education, and who knows what kinds of advances will improve this system?

Currently, the process of becoming an expert in a field who is able to contribute meaningful research to its development requires about 20-25 years of education. Of those, only 5-10 are spent studying material that is directly pertinent to that field. We can definitely do better in this regard. A restructuring of K-12 curriculum to eliminate waste and introduce important emerging fields could be one of the first steps towards this end. Better methods to absorb and retain information could exponentially decrease the amount of time spent learning, and thus completely negate or even reverse the effects you mentioned.

While I can't say for sure which forces will push harder in either direction, you should also consider that knowledge is becoming more easily accessible and the process of accessing that information under critical development.

I think you mostly touch on the ideas that have *already* prevented those limits from being reached in your post, but don't explain why the rules are changing. The reason I don't believe this will happen (at least not in the near future-- the introduction of advanced deep learning tech will almost certainly produce information that is beyond the grasp of human knowledge today.) is because once we discover something, teaching that thing is almost infinitely easier than the time it took to discover that thing. Computers are a great example-- they took almost a century from the prototypical idea of a computer to a computer that would be somewhat recognizable today, and have accelerated greatly over the past 3 decades. However, if you're a computer scientist, you probably spend at most a few classes learning all of that information throughout your academic life. 

Calculus is the same way. It took (essentially) one guy to write the rules to calculus, something no one before him really grasped, and now anyone interested in mathematics can learn that information in a year or two. 

Essentially it boils down to the fact that you don't have to ""relearn"" the info in every human life time.

1043,t3_4dat5a,"This is going to be fairly simplistic, but useful. Imagine human knowledge as a circle.

Previously, humans learned very general things. You can imagine the total knowledge as a circle with a small radii representing depth and the interior of an arc as the breadth of the individuals knowledge. The breadth of knowledge was necessary as food shortages forced any one member into a variety of roles. As advancements in food came about, individuals were able to specialize and gain more knowledge in any one field while sacrificing knowledge in other fields. This can be represented as the circle of human knowledge expanding while the individual's slice becoming smaller. As humans become more and more specialized due to a larger and larger food surplus driving population growth, a given individual will be able to continually expand human knowledge, while knowing a lesser breadth.

So while human knowledge expansion may slow down, the limiting factor is not the knowledge itself but food surplus. It the rate of human growth slows down, then knowledge expansion will slow down but not until then.

I think the main reason I stopped thinking about it is the following: I think that we can postpone that moment for a very long time. Too long to make plans on how humans would even work at that moment.

&gt; spends a considerable time (years or decades depending on the domain) acquiring what others had built in that domain.

Let's say the limit would be reached if a field requiers like 60 years of study to be up to date. Nowadays, even when studying several connected subject (e.g : several Quantum physics subjects) , we barely spend 10 year studying it.

So i am pretty sure we still have a very long road to getting somewhat near to the limit!

If this limit is reached in a few hundred years, imagine how much would changed in the way we learn/think/research.  (Cf how much has changed in the last 50 years!)

Then what would happen would be more related to sience-fiction / imagination:

- Better teaching methods
- Biological enhancement to have memory work better (larger storage and better retrieving)
- Biological enhancement to have brain work faster (and we would improve the efficiency of the drug faster than we get to the limit in the domain of drug optimisation ...)
- Doubled life expectancy 
- Computers designed to inject knowledge into our brains ( ""I know kung fu"" matrix learning style)
- Having (quantum) computers smart enough to do the research themselves.

1045,t3_4dat5a,"This is a relatively simple point, but I think it is also worth noting that specialization has a role to play in combating the knowledge overload problem. 

Medicine is perhaps the most obvious example of information overload; it's impossible for a single physician to treat every possible disease state or even know how to go about proper diagnosis and initial management; rather they know when they don't know the answer and refer to colleagues with different specializations. We've gone from ""Doctors vs. Surgeons"" to separating out even individual fields into subspecialties (like interventional radiologist vs. diagnostic radiologist vs. interventional neuroradiologist).

I think medicine disciplines are somewhat unique because that knowledge needs to be active knowledge; you can't rely on the internet for near-instantaneous access, you need to know it, confidently, in the moment, so it's a better way of assessing whether individual humans are getting knowledge overload.

So the solution is not longer and longer training times (although we are seeing that to some degree), but rather more branch points within training, and becoming more specialized. This is obviously enhanced by the fact that the professors themselves are becoming more specialized.

I'm not in academics, but I think that a similar process is likely occurring there; you aren't a chemist any more, you are a quantum chemist or a thermodynamic modeling chemist or a macromolecular organic chemist.

We do this in all areas of technology. Instead of needing to learn how to wire an entire building we color code the wires and terminals. Instead of needing to know how to create dovetail joints we buy our furniture at IKEA. 

We even build machines to find shortcuts for the shortcuts...

871,t3_62igvv,"I think you're making a fundamental error in approaching this from the perspective of ""validity"" rather than competing values.  Most disputed political issues come down not to a question of fact or logic, but rather a question of balancing opposing values that have been brought into conflict.

Broadly speaking (although I'm sure some people will still quibble with me on these), conservative values center on tradition, personal freedom, and personal responsibility, while liberals tend to prioritize egalitarianism, community, and challenging the status quo.  Importantly, neither group has an exclusive claim to their values; almost everyone agrees that all of these are good things.  The difference between the groups is how they *prioritize* these values.

There are a number of experiences that are very common in higher education (regardless of focus) that can lead people to reconsider the relative value that they place on each of these.  

For example:

1) College is often the first time young people are significantly exposed to diverse racial and ethnic groups or LGBTQ people.

2) College is often a student's first serious exposure to the social sciences, which complicate the narrative of personal choice with powerful social, psychological, and political forces.

3) Universities explicitly foster a spirit of inquiry and the questioning of orthodoxy, which can challenge people who prioritize respect for tradition as a core value.

Crucially, though, none of these experiences *invalidate* conservative values.  It is not a question of liberals being right and conservatives being wrong.  Rather, a variety of factors in higher education tend to result in, not new *information*, or a better *analysis*, but a new appreciation for values that had previously been lower on the priority list.",dfnjh4c,CMV: The fact that people with higher levels of education tend to be more liberal is an indicator that conservative voters' (who tend to be less educated) views lack validity and may be based off of ill-conceived preconceptions of the way the world works.,578,1,566,2022-05-11T12:13:46.602747Z,2022-05-11T12:13:46.602771Z,55.116,Cultural identity

833,t3_62igvv,"You claim that less educated voters use their gut and educated voters use data yet the example you gave is based on your gut.

The center for Immigration Studies released data that there is no major job types that are majority immigrant. This means that illegal immigrants ARE competing for the same jobs that native born americans are, not sectioning themselves into these mythical ""jobs that Americans won't do"" category.

Furthermore you shouldn't assume that formal education is such a strong factor in how critically people think or why people vote a certain way. The divide between conservative and liberal views is probably more based on self interest than one side being dumb and the other ""educated"". Rural voters tend to be conservative and they are affected more by immigrants competing for jobs, have less diversity(therefore tend to have less interest in civil rights, social justice issues} and tend to benefit less from taxes, as public works and services are more concentrated in cities.

The best example of both sides critically thinking yet voting differently due to environment is gun control. Areas(large cities) with high concentrations of liberal voters tend to live in more populated areas and tend to typically have the benefit of police showing up quickly in response to crimes and also are more likely to notice irresponsible gun use(gang violence etc.) On the flip side a conservative voter in a rural area might see more value in keeping guns around because police wouldn't be able to respond fast enough if their house was broken into, and due to being in a rural area they see more utility to the use of guns for hunting.

So really voting is more a matter of issues affecting people differently and therefore coming to different conclusions on what policy should be.

Those jobs are undesirable for people not just because the job itself sucks but the pay sucks too. Employers can hire cheap illegal labor for way less than a normal citizen. The reliance on that labor just means it will take so much longer for that job to actually have a competitive wage.  

It's interesting to me because Democrats push for a higher minimum wage, but they use a similar argument as Republicans against raising the minimum wage to what I said above about illegal immigrant labor. ""Everything will get more expensive! Small business owners can't afford that!"" Everything won't necessarily be so much more expensive anymore than it'd be so much more expensive after raising the minimum wage, but the left still fights for that here.

Many, many, Republicans are *socially* conservative, but would be more accurately called fiscally liberal (voting for larger government for defense spending, or to prop up the failing industries they used to have jobs in, for example). They've just been convinced that these social issues are massively more important than how they feel about fiscal policy. 

Convincing uneducated people to vote against their own self-interests takes talent and effort, though admittedly, it's not as hard to convince dumb uneducated people of such things than smarter ones. 

You would be hard pressed to characterize people like the Koch brothers as being ""dumb"" (and they are certainly college educated). 

There's also a pretty serious problem with the entire ""conservative vs. liberal"" dichotomy. 

You point to STEM graduates as being more ""liberal"", but that is really only true on social issues. What is interesting to note is that large numbers of them are more accurately called libertarians who are socially liberal and fiscally conservative.

It does not, however, follow that red trousers are a more intelligent choice of clothing.

Moreover, wearing red trousers became a way of *signalling* your membership in that demographic.

The demographic of college-educated people may hold certain views or find certain things fashionable even though these views are not directly caused by their being college educated.

Also, if being liberal is correlated to higher education, then higher education is correlated to being an anti-vacciner and consuming homeopathic medication, as that is correlated more with liberals. That's a sign college isn't teaching them to think critically.

263,t3_6ihcuk,"&gt; Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance.

There is a point at which no life exists, right? And there is a point at which a life definitely exists, right?

That means without a doubt that there must also be a point at which the non-life becomes a life.

It's not a matter of there being *impossible* to decide when life begins, it's that we can't agree on when it is.

So I reject your notion that ""any dividing line is pointless,"" there absolutely is an answer, we just all need to agree on it.

Personally, I've decided that I'm not knowledgeable about the science behind it to decide when a fetus (or group of cells, or whatever) becomes functional enough to become considered a living being worthy of rights, but doctors are. As with most things, I put my trust in those more knowledgeable than I am who use the science involved in measuring something to tell me the answer.

And their answer is after one trimester. (or more accurately, that's the point at which we can be sure)

Now, you can disagree with me that that's the most accurate time, (you'd be basing your decision off emotion, not science, but that's up to you) but that doesn't mean it's arbitrary or wrong.

There is absolutely, 100% a point at which a non-life becomes a life, the issue is not everyone agrees on when that point is. But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. That just means the question is, should we base it on what knowledgeable doctors who study the science tell us it should be, or an emotional response?

Definitions of personhood aren't arbitrary or up to technology or chance. A common definition of personhood used by the ""pro-life""-movement is that personhood is simply a human life and thus starts at conception. There is nothing up to chance with that definition. 

Another commonly used definition of personhood is based around the notion of self-awareness. In this case, not even infants would be considered persons, since self awareness takes a while a develop. Importantly, this definition means that we should also treat animals with self awareness (apes, whales etc) as persons and grant them fundamental rights.

You're still arguing for a human/person distinction.

No one on the pro-choice side has ever claimed that a fetus isn't human, clearly it is. The question has always been whether or not it's a person.

And I'll note that the religious right in America has only **VERY** recently come to the conclusion that personhood begins at conception.

Christianity Today, the flagship magazine of the Evangelical Right, was publishing articles immediately after Roe praising the decision as morally and religiously correct. Books on Christian ethics published up until around 1975 were in near universal agreement that ensoulment didn't take place until late in a pregnancy or even at the moment of birth, and that therefore abortion was not a moral issue except for those Evil Catholics (and everyone knows Catholics are't really Christians).

It wasn't until the late 1970's that the religious right suddenly switched to believing that abortion was the ultimate evil, and that switch didn't fully complete until the early 1980's.

What confuses the matter is that the American right never admitted that it changed its mind, or examined why it did. Instead the right has chosen to pretend that nothing changed and that they were always anti-abortion.

I think your ""we don't care much about human life"" argument is a non-starter though.

Breaking a rock doesn't matter much unless it matters to people, and breaking a person in half matters precisely because it's a person we're breaking in half.

I'm pro-choice myself but I think the move away from ""personhood"" ignores a central concern. What's more crucial is whether a fetus's personhood (or lack thereof) matters *enough* to outweigh the other interests at stake. If a fetus isn't a person then it's not much of an issue. If it is a person then we've got to weigh the value of that fact against the other concerns in the situation.

290,t3_6ihcuk,"
&gt;The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes ""a person"" is pointless.

It's not at all pointless.

There's more to this issue than human life-if it's not a human life than it's part of a woman's body.

So if it's a life it's a murder issue, if it's not then it's a women's rights issue.

I think that this is why abortion is one of if not the most difficult political issues. To a person who feels that life begins at conception a pro-choicer is a endorsing murder. To a person who disagrees the pro-lifer is violating a woman's right to her own body.


&gt;That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.

We weigh risk versus reward.

So let's throw out speed limits and abortion and look at the concept of fighting.

We allow sports like MMA and boxing because the risk of injury, while high, can be offset by regulations and standards.

We don't allow pistol duels, however, because the risk shoots up beyond a point where regulations can properly control.

So higher speed limits assume risk but we offset that with safety technology, vehicle inspection, DWI laws and police presence.

We can't control for risk in an abortion. The risk is very nearly 100%-the goal is to end the pregnancy.

Now I'm pro choice so obviously I don't take the pro life view. But I don't believe that the comparison you're making really helps the debate-very few people would endorse activity that guarantees the death of a child.

287,t3_6ihcuk,"To me it makes more sense to define abortion as an artificial termination of a pregnancy, which can be done at any point during a pregnancy. Whether the fetus survives out of the womb is a separate question, and should not interfere with a person's rights over her own body. If the fetus is aborted after 8 months, chances are the baby will survive with medical support.

Of course, this makes for a more diffucult but also more interesting debate: How far do we go to keep aborted fetuses alive? (Or babies I suppose, once they're out of the womb.) To me, this is hard to answer before we can put a value on human life. For those who don't understand why that is hard: Imagine creating an AI that will work to make life on earth optimal. If you make the AI value quality of life too much, it will kill all humans but those who have good/great quality of life. If you value life itself too much, it will force all women into continuous pregnancies to get as many humans as possible.",dj8lonk,"CMV: The only logically way to reconcile the abortion debate is to admit that abortion ends a human life, but also that protection of human life is not always the primary concern of the law.",1172,1,1150,2022-05-13T17:16:36.463970Z,2022-05-13T17:16:36.463998Z,42.37,Quality of Life
266,t3_6ihcuk,"&gt; The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.

Actually this has been defined quite clearly for many centuries.  They called it ""the quickening"" and it was when the developing fetus *starts to move* on its own.  Any time before that the woman could ""cure"" herself of her illness with whatever herbal concoctions were available.   It is only in the recent disease that is called ""western culture"" that a woman's control over her body has been barbarically seized by the government.

&gt; Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves

And this is why the label of ""pro-life"" doesn't make a lot of sense.  Those people are ""pro-birth"".  They are mostly the same people that cut welfare programs calling them ""free handouts"" and put spikes on park benches.  

&gt; protection of human life is not always the primary concern of the law.

It seems you're using the word ""protection"" here to mean preservation.

There were good players, and there were bad players. Sure, as we got older, we experienced different physical changes. Like, I became chubby, and this other girl I know became really athletic.

Why do we need to split it up by gender? There are tons of women stronger and more athletic than me, and yet I'm more qualified to play on a major sports team than them simply because I'm a man. Sure, we can argue women have Women's Teams™, but it's a fact that most people only watch men's teams.

As an example, look at weight classing in combat sports.  The assumption is that people with a similar weight would be fairly matched, rather than pitting a smaller person against someone twice their size.

All they would need to do in the Olympics is have 2 to 4 generic qualifying standards for each event (instead of 1 for men and 1 for women) and then all athletes that meet them participate in their respective group.  Depending on how they do it, it could remain largely unchanged and be predominantly male and predominantly female in 2 of the groups; but, you'd potentially see a mix of men, women and transgenders in each group and since they would be of similar ability they would therefore, theoretically, have an equal and fair chance of winning.

By definition, the top of a sport shouldn't have anyone excluded. This includes ""all males"".

The difficulties of a trans only league or allowing MTF people to compete with genetic females is illustrative of a greater problem: lack of honesty.

.... 

The best argument I can think of lies with the brain. If you examine the structures of the human brain of a transgender female you should note that they are different from those of a standard mans. The structures in the frontal lobe, if memory serves, of a trans female basically match those of a genetic female. 

This can lead one to conclude we are looking at the wrong parts when determining gender. 

If we are looking at the wrong parts it is reasonable to  conclude that we may be in error in not labeling these people as women for athletic purposes.

Why?

The body is nothing more than a complex life support system for the brain. As the brain is the whole of our experience, the whole of who you are, it is the organ which should be looked at to determine gender not supplementary parts and structures which can be modified or removed without causing the death of the organism.

If we take the brain as the determining factor then there is no unfair advantage as  they would be classified as women because their brains are female. The brain being the determining factor renders the hormonal, and structural arguments for and against them moot.

So for most sports, we have a male and female category.  This is because typically (though not always) men would outperform women, and we would have no way of recognizing the athletic achievements of women.  However, given that only a finite number of people will ever get any recognition, why should a higher performing athlete not be recognized ahead of a lower performing athlete.  If a MtF trans athlete performs better at the 100 meter dash than all the women competing, how would it make any sense for one of those women to get a medal?  Moreover, if the guy who placed 4th in the men's category outperformed the women and the trans athletes, why should he not get a medal?  

We make these separate athletic categories so that people who have no business winning can feel like they have a shot at winning.  They therefore train and compete and we all get to watch.

Now if a child identifies as trans and their doctor agrees they can be put on hormone blockers which delays their puberty. At an age when the child is old enough to begin making life changing decisions (I think its 16 in the United States but am not entirely sure) the child can be given HRT to induce a puberty of whatever the gender they identify as.

This means that the gap between cis and trans people in regards to athletic performance will likely get smaller as time goes on and the medicine around gender dysphoria gets smaller.

So let's take this to basic human growth with puberty.

The MtF, which I'm taking a guess here as I have not found any information saying so, went through puberty as a male, meaning they had their muscles develop on the lines of a biological male before transitioning, giving her an unfair advantage over top of her competitors. They do have rules against this, like her testosterone levels needed to be below 10 nanomoles/liter meaning she contained as much testosterone as her biological female competitors during and 12 months prior to the competition. She also competed as a male body builder prior to her reassignment, meaning she more than likely passed puberty as a biological male which would give her an unfair advantage.

In practice, I don't think this has ever been a problem, and I believe it's possible to test for unusually high levels of testosterone.

&gt;Eligibility Guidelines

&gt;Considering the most up-to-date medical and expert information available at the time of the implementation of this policy, participation is open to:

&gt;1. People designated female at birth, regardless of their gender identity.

&gt;1.1 The athlete may not take testosterone hormone therapy. Athletes transitioning to male who undergo hormone therapy will be ineligible to compete.

&gt;2. Those who transition from male to female are eligible to compete under the following conditions:

&gt;2.1. The athlete has declared that her gender identity is female. The declaration cannot be changed, for sporting purposes, for a minimum of four years.

&gt;2.2. The athlete must demonstrate that her total testosterone level in serum is within typical limits of women athletes.

&gt;2.3. The athlete's total testosterone level in serum must remain in the typical range of women athletes throughout the period of desired eligibility to compete in the female category.

&gt;2.4. Compliance with these conditions may be monitored by testing. In the event of non-compliance, the athlete’s eligibility in the league will be suspended for 12 months.

632,t3_60u6bk,"Gender isn't biological.  Sex is biological.  So right away that shuts the argument down.  We knew what you meant.

The fact is that they're perceived to have an advantage due to their appearance and belief that MTF trans women are actually still men dressed up.  But, we can measure all the levels they have of whatever and see that they are quite clearly female.  Aside from a few tiny things, on paper you wouldn't really know the difference after a successful transition.

Agreeably, it shouldn't be right at the start of therapy.  I can see a few years being required now.  But in total that's just not an accurate judgement.

Besides, sports are already subject to luck by birth.  Michael Phelps is an amazing swimmer for reasons beyond his control.  Is that technically an advantage?  He didn't choose his body shape and he can blow out of the water anyone who trains even harder.

I have a high center of gravity so lifting things for me is easier.  If I trained 100 hours next to someone else, I'd come out on top easily (if we eliminated variables).  So do I *deserve* gold because I was born at a specific time to specific people and an environment that helped me?

If you truly believe that a person is the gender they identify with most, then their biological sex is just another physical characteristic, no different than height.

There's a number of problems this might cause, considering that effects of hormone therapy can differ between individuals, not to mention that any change in performance for MTF athletes would be different than those experienced by FTM athletes.

The issue boils down to this; how significantly do gender-reassignment procedures/therapy alter the performance of an individual? If it doesn't bring them in line with the performance levels of their intended gender, then they are getting an unfair advantage or disadvantage as a result. Then again, if they *are* brought in line with the target gender's expected performance, does that mean that some innate excellence might have been quashed, or that they've been given more athletic capability than they'd have had if they'd been born their target gender?

The way I see it is that current gender-reassignment techniques are simply not adequate for athletes, and that unfortunately means that individuals who undergo gender-reassignment should either be placed in their own categories or simply not allowed to compete. If and when the technology advances far enough that gender-reassignment can be done at the DNA level, the issue can be revisited, but as it is there's simply too many things that can't be controlled for.

Hormone therapy for gender-reassignment has drastically body-altering effects, which is absolutely the intent, but because of this they need to be treated similarly to other performance-altering substances like Steroids.",df9tscn,CMV: Transgender (specifically MtF) athletes have an unfair advantage in strength-based sports and should only be able to participate in their biological gender group.,1729,1,850,2022-05-15T15:26:09.363092Z,2022-05-15T15:26:09.363092Z,111236.698,Technology and innovation
