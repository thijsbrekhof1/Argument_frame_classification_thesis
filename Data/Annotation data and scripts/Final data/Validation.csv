Dogs and humans have evolved alongside one another in a symbiotic way. We benefit one another. This has resulted in a very unique bond. Dogs have evolved to trust humans. They are the only animals to communicate with humans via eye contact. Think about it. You're dog looks you in the eye when you are talking to it or it wants to communicate something with you. No other animals do this. They are tuned into our emotions. They know how to read if we are happy, angry or upset. Some dogs (like mine) have even evolved to copy human smiling - which does result in a creepy look but they're trying! 
Ultimately they have evolved to trust us and help us. They have never been meat to humanity and to betray their trust of us in such a way makes me ashamed to be human.

478,t3_4otmqi,"&gt;What about cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, etc that we eat? 

None of these are ""predator"" animals. A dog is naturally a predator animal that is descended from wolves which eat meat.

As we were once hunters and still are we have a very strong connection to other hunter species and respect them. Its because we can form hunting bonds with dogs, and cats we can live mutually exclusively. Pigs don't provide anything except meat. Cows provide milk and chickens provide eggs but can they defend your homestead against other predators or other hunters? Not really. A dog can though, A cat can go against most vermin. 

In the wild if it was me against a dog, nature doesn't give a shit and a dog would easily eat me and I would eat it. But we live in society and dogs love society and we should respect them for that. 

In short dogs are our bros. Hunters don't eat other hunters, mainly because its too dangerous but for humans today, its out of respect for how rare  some hunters are and that we are on the same side.

474,t3_4otmqi,"The difference of opinion on eating dogs versus other domesticated animals is not one of morality, but rather it is the nature of the domestication.

The most pervasive theory on the origin of the modern dog is that humans began the relationship by taking docile pups and using them to help hunt, guard camps, and other utilitarian purposes.  Modern dogs have evolved alongside humans to perform all kinds of different tasks; we have bred them to hunt, herd, and guard for us.  We have even bred them for purely aesthetic purposes, i.e. ""cute,"" ""tall,"" ""short,"" etc.

In the west, this utilitarian view of dogs is pervasive and is akin to horses (which are also not seen as a source of food).  While other cultures do not see dogs in a similar fashion, the evolution of the modern dog was not based on being a food source, it is based off of their utilitarian traits.  This, and only this, is the distinction between eating, say, a cow or a pig (domesticated and bred for the purpose of being a food source) and eating a horse or a dog (domesticated to assist us with various tasks).

I think a good analogy would be the difference between roses and corn.  Both are domesticated plants, but the rose was domesticated because some humans decided it was pretty, while corn was domesticated because some humans figured out it was edible.

I should note that my position is toward dogs and dogs only. Cats are a much more recent addition to human life and are far less useful from a security or hunting perspective, so they are not part of the equation. Horses are arguably more useful alive than dead, but they too are a much more recent addition to human life, so they don't count either.

463,t3_4otmqi,"Dogs are of similar puzzle-solving intelligence to many farm animals, and probably lower than pigs there, but are of higher social/emotional intelligence. There are plenty of animals that we are discovering are quite high on the raw intelligence scale (crows, parrots, etc), but it is really the level of social intelligence that governs how much we empathize with these animals. Monkeys, apes, whales, dolphins, elephants, dogs. All of these are animals that are able to feel ""love"" as we understand it for members outside of their direct family group ([though dogs are limited on some higher-order emotions that we sometimes assume they have](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201303/which-emotions-do-dogs-actually-experience)).

It's because of the empathy we can feel for these animals that they fall in separate category when it comes to the people who step forward to defend them in cases like these. For dogs, especially, since they are raised as companions, we see these social behaviors firsthand as well as the range of their emotions.

So while from a ""capability to suffer"" standpoint this does not separate a dog from a chicken (unless we consider the suffering of the survivors), this should at least explain why people emotionally categorize chicken separately from dogs, and also why those categorizations are not totally invalid.

I would note that at least for pigs, studies have demonstrated a fairly sophisticated emotional intelligence, so arguments to separate them from dogs lose most ethical footing and mostly boil down to suitability as a companion.

Yet when harvesting foods millions of insects, rodents, and birds are killed every year. Where is the outcry from the vegans over this travesty? Why aren't vegans avoiding all corn and wheat based foods?

Bottom line: It is hypocritical of vegans to judge others for killing animals when they themselves contribute to the killing of animals as well.

1. I once saw this quote on reddit ""You know what the problem is with being an economist? Everyone has an opinion about the economy. No body goes up to a geologist and says, 'Igneous rocks are fucking bullshit.'""
People tend to have opinions on basic economic issues that are not up for debate. For example, Trump and his supporters are against free trade, despite the fact that it has had unanimous support from economists. This is the first reason to learn about economics, understanding important concepts, graphs, and trends will help you weed through what is obviously bullshit in the national discussion.

2. Some stuff is disagreed upon by economists. However, many economists develop their stance due to implicit and confirmation biases. Supply siders are often- not by coincidence- lifelong conservatives who hold conservative values. It is important to have a knowledge of economics in order to determine what the data says rather than what people's opinions are. For example, if you learn that trickle down economics is not based in fact, you can form an opinion on what the marginal tax rate should be based on your values, rather than based on the idea that a lower marginal rate will help the poor. 

3. You talk about being right in regards to foreign policy and economics, which is only the case when something is universally or overwhelmingly beneficial to everyone. For example, you can be right about the Iraq War or Free Trade, but you can't be right about what how much we should tax the rich.

I infer that this is because you believe that consensus among ""experts"" is a good indication of the validity of a theory or opinion.

This is a very dangerous error to make.

These ""experts"" you look to, i.e. economists and political scientists, rarely if ever test their theories and hypotheses with randomized controlled experiments. Not because they are evil, but because these tests are typically economically and politically impossible.

Unfortunately, the iteration of generating hypotheses and testing them through rigorous experimentation is the only somewhat reliable way we know to produce knowledge of causal effects.

If an analysts makes a claim of the sort, policy A would cause effects B, C and D, that claim amounts to a causal assertion. The final authority on the truth of which is always rigorous experiment - not consensus of any social group, no matter what their job title. 

If you have spare time to inform yourself of anything, I recommend epistemology and the philosophy of science. Once you know how to reliably produce knowledge, then you can take a look at the methods used by the people you revere as experts. I think you will find in many cases that it amounts to fancy statistical speculation rather than science.

Professions are much like religions in that they are social groups bound together by ideas. You wouldn't take consensus among Mormons on their doctrine as evidence for the validity of the doctrine. Apply the same logic to the professions. 

The greatest idea in science is that the final authority on truth is the result of experiment - not the opinion of the researcher.

The arguments that lead to a policy decision stem from core beliefs, and understanding which core beliefs you agree with allows you to understand which policies you should side with.

For example, in US politics, a particular assumption that is frequently made is whether it is better to have a large central government, or a small central government.  Neither side can *prove* their position correct, and both sides will build upon this central concept to define their positions on other matters.  Which is better is likely subjective, rather than objective.  This means that you can develop an opinion on things like banking regulations by understanding the opinion of those who share your core beliefs.

The people who share core beliefs likely also have similar opinions in policy decisions.

Fundamentally this boils down to the fact that with some of these there is no ""right"" answer.  There are lots of wrong answers (ill thought out solutions, or objectively false assumptions), and for a given set of well defined constraints (core beliefs) there is likely a right answer, however the right answer depends on the constraints, which are different for different people (are subjective).",d8v17p8,"CMV: People who study complicated subjects like the economy and American foreign policy for a living are unable to agree on important policy questions, so it's pointless for me to try to develop an opinion on those policies.",1974,1,1095,2022-05-18T10:29:24.199600Z,2022-05-18T10:29:24.200600Z,1276.214,Public opinion

I object to this part. There is more to happiness/satisfaction/contentness/whatever than just not suffering. You can be varying degrees of happy.

A world where a few people suffer and many are super-happy is better than a world where nobody suffers and nobody is happy. We can argue about different types of doing the calculation, like whether it's total happiness or average happiness that matters, but in both cases a world with no people will be either mediocre (average utility zero) or terrible (total utility zero).

Most people don't kill themselves, so we can be confident that most people think their lives have more happiness than suffering. Extinguishing them will reduce more happiness than it would reduce suffering, driving both total and average value *down*.

&gt; So-called higher pleasures - art, music, intellectual pursuits - are all subservient to these needs, as they either function to A: distract us from unmet needs in ourselves or others or B: exist to facilitate the goal of meeting these needs.

The reason why we haven't killed ourselves off, besides fear of death itself, is because of happiness. It's a bit heavy handed, bear with me, but happiness... happiness does not mean the absence of suffering, far from it, but is entirely its own thing and hand waving it as a simple distraction is a little myopic, non?

Death accomplishes the end of suffering, but this is not why we live. We do not live to end suffering; we bear it and push forward to attain cute little moments of happiness.

Extinction does not reduce human suffering at least as well as achieving an utopia would, it removes the humans who suffer.  

------------------------------- 

Satisfying needs quantifies an overall feeling of accomplishment (some basic needs like food which are necessary, some needs like internet which are not necessary to survive).  By ""quantifies"" I mean that, by your definitions, happiness is proportional to satisfied needs. 

For extinction to reduce suffering, it means that this quantified feeling is somehow improved, compared to now. For extinction to reduce suffering at least as well as a utopia, means that I can compare this overall feeling of accomplishment in satisfying my needs. 

But extinction does not reduce suffering, it removes suffering by removing needs. You can say that removing needs is equal to satisfying them (I have the need to eat, I built a system that keeps me alive without eating, the need of eating is satisfied) but without me being aware of that what you have achieved is not reducing suffering but removing the object which suffers.

In other words, suffering of a conscious being exists only if the conscious being exists as well. There is no suffering to be improved without something that suffers being aware of it. You remove the need to boil the water before making coffee by removing coffee.

I've 'suffered' boredom countless times memorizing new information or mastering a skill through repetition of something mindless, which left me needful of stimulation or excitation at the time only to grant me satisfaction(another need) later. 

So I guess my argument is twofold; firstly, a utopia would not actually relieve suffering of all kinds, since *relative* suffering is ultimately irreducible as it relies on a concept of 'normal' which is fluid; secondly, the potential satisfaction of suffering averted/overcome would disappear from humanity after genocide but not after utopia.

I might also point out that that there is a tremendous amount of trepidation, anxiety, heartbreak and despair that accompanies extinction which manifestly does *not* accompany utopia, and I feel your argument is thusly indefensible when you say that utopia would cause the same amount of suffering.

Let's step away from the sense in which your statement is necessarily true and turn towards a sense of human preferences we'll call Utility. How do you know suffering is bad, because people extend resources and effort to avoid it. Preferences, summarized as Utility, inform at least some of your world view.

So from your post I would guess a simplified version of your argument would be that a person in non-existence would have no needs unfulfilled, and a person in a Utopia would have no needs or more than a person in non existence unfulfilled, therefore the Utility of not existing must be better than the Utility of living in a Utopia.

B) The original copyright holder is entitled to seek out royalties. This should work similar to the current rules for recording cover songs. Currently, you do not need permission to sell a recording of your performance of a copyrighted song but you are expect to pay royalties based on your sales (i.e. if you don't successfully sell a single copy, you owe nothing, if your cover ends up selling millions, the song writer is legally entitled to a pretty nice check).

347,t3_4sntrj,"&gt;The premise is this: If you create something, it becomes part of the culture in which you live.

This really isn't the premise. The premise of copyright (and patents, etc.) is this: Having people create things is good for society, even if we give them exclusive rights to sell those things, and people would create much less if they didn't have those exclusive rights.

So we give them exclusive rights, because we want them to create, even if that means that they are the only ones that can profit from them.

Even with copyright, people are free to allow something to become part of culture immediately if they want to. Evidence suggests that that is not what motivates people to create... otherwise they would do that. People create largely because they can make a living (and potentially a reasonable retirement) off of their creations.

Society is benefited *no matter* who profits from the creation, simply by the fact of creation. Even an *infinite* copyright term would be a good bet for society if, indeed, it got people to create significantly more.

The *vast* majority of stuff is forgotten even in 15-20 years. 

It's those *exceptional* things that last for decades that we even institute copyright for in the first place. Those are exactly the things that we want to incentivize people to create.

Assuming the first work is of high enough merit to support the creator for life, I disagree that we should encourage creators to churn out new art solely to make money.

An artist who struck gold once is not necessarily going to strike gold again and again. Say, To Kill a Mockingbird and Go Set a Watchman if we accept Go Set a Watchman as a sequel (although it of course has some dubious publication history that make this unlikely). It's unfair to the creator to force them to publish constantly, rather than let them publish when and if creativity and novel ideas strike them.

Artists who are interested in being creative have had no problem continuing to publish despite wealth - take J.K. Rowling or numerous musical artists. And, if a piece of art can support its creator for life, it has certainly been adopted into popular culture.

The renewal period allows for the quick passage of most works into the public domain, while allowing for commercially viable works to remain so for many years to come. The 50 year maximum is long enough that even for most works that are still commercially viable, the creator would have likely retired or died, so a longer copyright duration is unlikely to encourage more creation (which is supposed to be the entire point of copyright).

The renewal system is a direct response to the problem of abandoned works under copyright, which are no longer used by the owner, but can also not be used by anyone else, often because the owner cannot be found.

I think this is the key piece that we should focus on. What would your goal be? Would you like to allow other people to copy and sell the work for money after 20 years instead of 170?

From society's point of view, what would be the difference today? Someone will do the selling. With an endless amount of competition from other content creators, they wouldn't be able to, and it also wouldn't be in their interest to charge a prohibitive amount. Whoever is doing the selling will still need to charge something. Whether it's paper, or CD's, or bandwidth, or hosting a website, or lastly, time, there will be some non zero cost.

There was a time when you might be forced to buy bundled things that you didn't want. $20 dollars for a VHS movie meant you were forced to buy packaging (A significant cost), and an insurance premium in case the retailer couldn't move inventory (retailer margin, even larger than packaging). But today, there is very little argument left for this. You can watch a movie over the internet for close to nothing, bypassing any unwanted packaging and physical media, and there's no risk premium that you need to pay for the seller's inventory risks.

A parent can't force a child to be active or exercise, especially if that child has a physical ailment or disability like asthma, etc. Many parents don't have the ability to constantly monitor a child's food intake or activity level, as they're away from the home a lot of the time (working long hours, for example). Plus any kid with a decent level of autonomy and an allowance can walk/bike to the local store and buy as much junk food as they like.

A child might have a decent diet, but if the combination of their physiology and activity level causes their weight to rocket out of control, how much blame can you put on the parents.

It'd be lovely to think that a visit from a dietician and a social worker would do the trick, but given that habits are very hard to break, in many cases the family wouldn't substantially alter their behaviour. At this point, what happens? In traditional child neglect/abuse scenarios, if a home visit and maybe some sort of support (in this case maybe vouchers for healthy food or free vegetable delivery or something), if the situation doesn't improve, the state would be compelled to remove the child from the home and place them in foster care. 

This in and of itself is traumatising to the child (and is associated with a dramatically increased risk of future drug abuse, teen/unwed pregnancy, mental health problems, etc) and they'd have to remain in care until the parent - what? - learns to cook healthy meals?

Also, my argument would be that if something like an obese child was evidence of child abuse it would cast a social stigma on those with children who have actual metabolic disorders that can lead to obesity. There are medical issues that can contribute heavily (no pun intended) to obesity. The children are also not perfect little angels. Some children steal food from the pantry, other students at school, or find other ways to get food that their parent may not know about.

245,t3_5j6wiw,"In addition to some other excellent answers here, it's worth noting that the bar to scientifically prove something is extremely high, and in many cases unobtainable, despite a scientific *consensus* on the topic.  In this case we have a group of experts with interpretations and *opinions* on a set of facts.  What's more, you (almost certainly), me, and the people you're complaining about, aren't qualified to make the same opinions.  We can't properly interpret the evidence.  However, we can (and usually do) have an opinion on whatever issue still.  It's just based on an unavoidable mix of emotional bias, our feelings about the experts who interpret the actual facts, their opinions, and, unfortunately, our stubborn tendency to assume we're right.

Climate change is a good example of this, because it's also the type of topic people might have ""opinions"" on.  The fact of the matter is that despite all of the evidence we have collected in support of a lot of the relevant aspects of climate change, they're still not proven.  What we do have is the majority of climate scientists that are of the *opinion* that our current understanding of climate change is at least real enough to be taken seriously and acted upon.  What's key here though is that it's climate scientists with these opinions.  They're the ones with the relevant knowledge and background to interpret the evidence.  And (unless you're a climate scientist) you and I can't.  The best we can do is form an opinion on how much weight we give to what climate scientists are saying based on what we see of that debate.

242,t3_5j6wiw,"Oh, this one is tricky. 


The issue lies in the often unspecific uses of words like ""opinion"" or ""scientific evidence."" An opinion is not only a perspective, but can also be a well constructed idea as well. Similarly, science may be our best bet at finding the answers behind things, but like any person, a scientist is vulnerable to mistakes, corruption, etc. 


If you don't consider the ambiguity of a word, you are bound to make a lot of errors in communication. This is why most scientific terms have very strict definitions. 


The problem with all ideas of truth is you can never rid any argument of at least a minute degree of uncertainty. Science generally only minimizes that uncertainty, it can't claim that anything is a perfect truth above any skepticism, as skepticism is an essential part of science's success. 


In some ways a perception is truer than any fact because it represents the ideas of the holder as accurately as words can describe. Saying: ""I think being gay is disgusting"" does not mean that as a fact all gays are disgusting, but it usually means that the idea that the person holds that view is nearly completely factual.

241,t3_5j6wiw,"Semantics. All semantics.

&gt; ""Well, being gay isn't natural, that's just my opinion.""

What is meant by *natural*? The person with this *opinion* may be using the word to mean something very unscientific.

&gt; ""You can't lose weight eating nothing but twinkies, that's just my opinion.""

Sounds more like a challenge than a claim about whether or not it's physically *possible*. Maybe the speaker simply means to say that they find it so highly improbable that anyone would manage to successfully lose weight in a healthy manner via this method that it may as well be considered impossible.

The problem is that people don't always say exactly what they mean in a way that makes sense to the person with whom they are communicating.

Additionally, the definition of ""proof"" is essential as well. After all, ""proof"" is nothing more than whatever it takes to *convince* someone. If something is *scientifically proven*, that means that *scientists have been convinced*. (Fun fact: **there really is no such thing as ""[scientific proof](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200811/common-misconceptions-about-science-i-scientific-proof)""**. Science only has the ability to *disprove*. By process of elimination, whatever is left that cannot yet be disproven tends to be the prevailing theory.)

Even the word ""opinion"" is contextual. It can mean different things, depending on what context everyone involved in the conversation agrees on. Casually, it simply means *view* or *judgment*, regardless of whether or not the view is right or wrong, or if the judgment is fair or poor. Only when its clear that you're speaking in strictly logical terms can it be truly asserted that *claims about objective facts* are incompatible with *subjective opinions*.",dbduer3,CMV: I do not think that people can have opinions on anything that can be proven scientifically or factually.,2145,1,1266,2022-05-19T13:12:49.060477Z,2022-05-19T13:12:49.060477Z,29.515,Other

&gt; sexual activity, courtship, affection, pair bonding, and parenting among same-sex animal pairs
