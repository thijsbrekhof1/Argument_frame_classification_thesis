931,t3_64kkxe,"Overbooking should not be illegal, but it should be very carefully managed.

When you buy a ticket, the airline is committing to get you from A to B, but the cost savings to you come because it is 'at their discretion'. If you need more control, call up your local charter operator and book on your own terms.  Airlines need flexibility in how they operate due to many regulatory, natural, mechanical and human factors involved with aviation.  This includes shuffling passengers as needed ( while taking the customer service hit)

A better solution in my view is better consumer insight into which airlines operate which way.   Did you know jetblu doesn't overbook but they also do not have any agreements in place with other carriers to rebook you on another airline if needed?

918,t3_64kkxe,"I see that your view has already been changed, but I thought I'd chime in with some additional info regarding flyer's rights in the US.  According to the US Department of Transport, there are two kinds of acceptable ""bumping"" from overbooked flights: voluntary and involuntary.  Voluntary bumping is the most frequent type, and this is what you normally see when the airline offers you incentives to voluntarily take a later flight.  Carriers are given a lot of freedom in how they negotiate with passengers in order to get volunteers, but it is frequently in the carrier's interest to get volunteers.  This is due to the regulations around involuntary bumping.  

Involuntary bumping requires the airline to arrange alternative travel arrangements that get the customer to their intended destination within 1 hour of their original scheduled arrival time.  If the customer arrives between 1 and 2 hours late, the carrier is forced to pay significant penalties to the customer for the inconvenience.  Any more than 2 hours incurs a 400% penalty that the carrier must pay to the customer.  This is all to protect the customer from overzealous overbooking.  The official rules are a bit more nuanced than my synopsis, and you can read them in their entirety here: https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights

So while overbooking can be problematic, I don't think it should necessarily be illegal.  The rules set out by the US DOT offer more than adequate protection for the customer while also allowing the carrier to fill all of their seats through informed overbooking.",dg3cm1o,CMV: Overbooking should be illegal.,532,1,520,2022-05-11T11:21:10.086218Z,2022-05-11T11:21:10.086244Z,392.822,Capacity and resources

Had this been a case of overbooking with revenue passengers it would've looked more like this--100 passenger plane, 110 booked passengers, so 10 needed to be booted. That was not the case.

With that said airlines do this because there's a chance people miss flights (no-shows, missed connections). Airlines have this data and try to oversell within a reasonable amount. After all having to boot people off either using VDB or IDBs is inconvenient and costly. They have to reschedule the passenger AND pay compensation.

Overbooking is in most cases a victimless crime. That is to say, in most cases, even though flights are overbooked, nobody has to leave the plane.  
The amount of overbooking is a carefully calculated number. Over the whole airlines know how many people are not going to show up to their flight.  
Have a flight of X passengers at date and time Y to destination Z an airline will know that (for example) 4 people on average aren't going to show up. Either being delayed, or cancelling or whatever reason.  
Now an airline has a choice, they can book to capacity, and wind up with 4 unsold tickets. This means that the airline eats the loss of those tickets, if they do this structurally, they'll have to find some way to recoup the losses. Perhaps by raising ticket prices in general.  
So if everything goes according to plan, everyone who arrives at the airport will be able to get on the plane, and everybody's happy, and they get to enjoy their cheap(er) tickets.

And this is of course the situations that the airline can control.  
There's things like bad weather (headwind), people bringing more luggage then expected, priority passengers and things like that.

Keeping those factors in mind, I would say that airlines aren't commiting fraud. They aren't selling tickets without the intention of ever providing the service they offer.

On any given flight, there is usually about a 10% no show rate, checked in late, missed their flight, missed connection due to delays, any number of reasons why people do not show up for their scheduled flights. Because of that high percentage of no shows airlines are able to overbook to ensure the flight goes out as full as possible. But we all know that doesn't always happen. In which case the airline will solicit for volunteers to come off that flight for compensation, and confirmed booking on another flight or another airline. Sometimes there are not enough volunteers, and that's when that job sucks. There is criteria used to select who to deny boarding. Most people denied boarding are upset but reasonable. The UA guy was not reasonable, hence the police being called. 

The flight was not originally overbooked, but had to be overbooked for dead heading crew, who will always have presidence over a passenger. Not getting that crew to their destination effects those passengers relying on the flights they were booked on.

913,t3_64kkxe,"Overbooking actually benefits everyone because it simplifies airline scheduling immensely.  
  
Let's say the last two flights of the day to Alaska from LA leave at 8:00pm and 9:00pm.  Both of these flights have five available seats.  
  
There's passengers landing in LA that need to get on one of those two flights to Alaska, arriving on two different planes in LA at 7:00pm and 7:10pm, each with 5 passengers.  
  
So how should we schedule this?  Obviously put the people on the 7:00pm arrival onto the 8:00pm departure and the 7:10pm arrival on the 9:00pm departure.  That way there's no overbooking.  No problemo.  
  
But what if the 7:00pm arrival is late?  Now there's 10 people trying to get on the 9:00pm flight, so at least 5 people are going to have to wait until tomorrow.  And maybe tomorrow is fully booked so they're screwed.  
  
But is there a solution to this?  Yes!  Overbook EVERYONE on the 8:00pm flight so that flight is 5 seats overbooked and the 9:00pm flight is underbooked.  When the first flight is late, the 7:10pm arrivers get on the 8:00pm flight and the 7:00pm plane that actually arrived at 8:10pm gets its passengers on the later flight.  And EVERYONE gets to Alaska that day because overbooking saved the day.
  
Of course this usually means 5 people will get bumped from the 8:00pm flight to the 9:00pm flight.  Most likely they'll find volunteers to do it for $150.  But that's totally fine.

Any airline is already free to choose not to overbook and to just increase their prices accordingly, but they haven't chosen to do that.

474,t3_4otmqi,"The difference of opinion on eating dogs versus other domesticated animals is not one of morality, but rather it is the nature of the domestication.

The most pervasive theory on the origin of the modern dog is that humans began the relationship by taking docile pups and using them to help hunt, guard camps, and other utilitarian purposes.  Modern dogs have evolved alongside humans to perform all kinds of different tasks; we have bred them to hunt, herd, and guard for us.  We have even bred them for purely aesthetic purposes, i.e. ""cute,"" ""tall,"" ""short,"" etc.

In the west, this utilitarian view of dogs is pervasive and is akin to horses (which are also not seen as a source of food).  While other cultures do not see dogs in a similar fashion, the evolution of the modern dog was not based on being a food source, it is based off of their utilitarian traits.  This, and only this, is the distinction between eating, say, a cow or a pig (domesticated and bred for the purpose of being a food source) and eating a horse or a dog (domesticated to assist us with various tasks).

I think a good analogy would be the difference between roses and corn.  Both are domesticated plants, but the rose was domesticated because some humans decided it was pretty, while corn was domesticated because some humans figured out it was edible.

Dogs are the only animals, besides humans, that will look in the eyes non-threateningly. And dogs only do this with humans (they avoid eye contact with other dogs). This is because dogs have evolved specifically to adapt to human society.

This is different that other domesticated animals which have made the animals docile for eating. Dogs were domesticated to work as partners with humans. They helps us hunt. They help us detect dangers. They help us with disabilities. And they provide a companionship no other pet does solely because they evolved to be ""man's best friend.""

There are few animals that have been domesticated as long, and even among those animals, none have been actual companions in the way that dogs have (except for perhaps cats). Humans have kept chickens and cows for less time than dogs, and have not treated them as true companions - they were livestock. Dogs on the other hand lived with humans, hunted at their side, helped herd other animals, ate by human's campfires and tables, etc.

Dogs aren't and haven't been livestock, they have **participated** in the human communities they live in, by doing a variety of important work as well as forming relationships with humans.

Yes, you can keep a pig as a pet. And you can love that pig and it can love you back. There is still a difference, the depth of human/dog companionship is a very old one. Its a part of dog genes, possibly a part of our genes too, and definitely a part of our culture.

Dogs have evolved alongside humans for millions of years as companions, whereas many of the animals that we traditionally eat in the west evolved as food animals. It is immoral to eat dogs because that is not their intended purpose according to millions of years of evolution and human behavior. As a result, dogs are much more useful as companions, security guards, and hunting partners than they are as food. Eating dogs is bad for the same reasons that human cannibalism is bad.

I should note that my position is toward dogs and dogs only. Cats are a much more recent addition to human life and are far less useful from a security or hunting perspective, so they are not part of the equation. Horses are arguably more useful alive than dead, but they too are a much more recent addition to human life, so they don't count either.

463,t3_4otmqi,"Dogs are of similar puzzle-solving intelligence to many farm animals, and probably lower than pigs there, but are of higher social/emotional intelligence. There are plenty of animals that we are discovering are quite high on the raw intelligence scale (crows, parrots, etc), but it is really the level of social intelligence that governs how much we empathize with these animals. Monkeys, apes, whales, dolphins, elephants, dogs. All of these are animals that are able to feel ""love"" as we understand it for members outside of their direct family group ([though dogs are limited on some higher-order emotions that we sometimes assume they have](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201303/which-emotions-do-dogs-actually-experience)).

It's because of the empathy we can feel for these animals that they fall in separate category when it comes to the people who step forward to defend them in cases like these. For dogs, especially, since they are raised as companions, we see these social behaviors firsthand as well as the range of their emotions.

So while from a ""capability to suffer"" standpoint this does not separate a dog from a chicken (unless we consider the suffering of the survivors), this should at least explain why people emotionally categorize chicken separately from dogs, and also why those categorizations are not totally invalid.

I would note that at least for pigs, studies have demonstrated a fairly sophisticated emotional intelligence, so arguments to separate them from dogs lose most ethical footing and mostly boil down to suitability as a companion.

Bottom line: It is hypocritical of vegans to judge others for killing animals when they themselves contribute to the killing of animals as well.

The argument can't be made that it is acceptable to kill these animals, because you've already established that drawing a line is not okay

Reality is that this is about equal protection or treatment under the law. The law currently allows two adults to marry, and enjoy all the benefits the law provides along with it.

Plural marriage is just a more complex incorporation. Even adding third of 4th people to an existing marriage is easily accommodated by adopting corporate law structures of ownership and liability. the trickiest to handle would be non-exclusive marriage, where one person could be married to two  people, each of which are not married to one another but also have separate spouses of their own that are not married to the center of the V that connects them all.

Generally this is better accomplished with two people rather than individuals. 

However there are other aspects to marriage's benefits: Married couples take care of eachother in old age, and generally establish some level of psychological wellbeing with eachother. This manifests with people being healthier and longer lived when their spouse is also alive. Another aspect of monogamy is that sexually transmitted diseases are not as easily spread because the sexual contact networks are less developed when most people are monogamous.

All of these benefits are called into question with polygamy: Sexual networks are more developed, allowing STDs to spread through a polygamist society more readily. The presence of multiple adults within the same unit skews power dynamics and may create disenfranchised parties within marriage units.

Because businesses are people too, and marriage is a useful financial tool for coupling assets. So denying business the right to do this, will give them financial losses that they could then sue the government for, then gaining some tax exception.

So you're right, all the standard arguments for gay marriage apply, but there's one more less rational argument you may have missed: ""We want it."" which doesn't apply for polygamy.",dmm1ggb,CMV: The same arguments that justify gay marriage also justify polygamy,2271,1,1392,2022-05-19T15:11:53.690928Z,2022-05-19T15:11:53.690928Z,73.372,Other
157,t3_6y8fi0,"&gt;However, I cannot think of any reason why polygamy should not be included in the umbrella of marriage given arguments for gay marriage.

Gay marriage does not cause social inequities like polygamy does.  They don't create a shortage of available spouses of one gender.  They aren't characterized by higher rates of child abuse, rape, kidnapping, murder, etc.  They don't typically involve one powerful person marrying multiple vulnerable people.  They don't lead to unfair divorces (e.g. separation of assets).  

The arguments in favor of gay marriage do not negate all the arguments against polygamy.

124,t3_6y8fi0,"If one man has three wives, two men have no wives. The man with three is usually rich and old, and the men with none are usually poor and young. A massive increase in young, poor, desperate, dissatisfied men is very bad for society. It leads to wars, crime, gangs, violence, vicious corporal punishment for infidelity (since the old ugly powerful guys are rightly paranoid about there wives wanting to fuck younger sexier men). 

In short, monogamy is a technology for passifying young men, which is incredibly beneficial for society. You may disagree with the details, but you couldn't even have this sort of conversation about gay marriage since it's still 1:1 and concerns less than 5% of the population. 

There are lots of society-level arguments against polygamy that don't apologise to gay marriage.

Edit: just to clarify that this is fact not speculation. Polygamist societies, both historical and contemporary, are riddled with social problems caused by the massive overabundance of desperate young men. They often solve them by being increasingly militaristic; effectively sending the young men off to fuck each other (usually rape) and die in battle, ensuring a much smaller population of older men (who are also rich with war spoils) who can then match 2:1 or 3:1 with the larger population of women. Of course, the constant warfare (besides being shit for everyone) is unsustainable and these societies either: settle in to a dynamic of mutual raiding with their polygamist neighbors (especially true for tribal pasturalist societies), collapse or become monogamists.

The slippery slope of polygamy doesn't lead to beastiality, it leads to war and mass suffering. ",dmlpf0d,CMV: The same arguments that justify gay marriage also justify polygamy,2262,1,1383,2022-05-19T15:04:53.477836Z,2022-05-19T15:04:53.477836Z,94.202,Policy prescription and evaluation

Because anything more than 2 becomes arbitrarily complex. 

If polygamous marriages are recognized, how many partners could that include? 3? Why not 4? Why not 10? Why not 3,000? 

Two is the minimal required complexity. Any number more than 2 is an arbitrary limit. Two is not arbitrary, as that's the number required for conception, regardless of whether the couple intends to, or is capable of conceiving. 

Furthermore, relationships of more than two individuals become exponentially more complex for government officials to vet for instances of fraud. Don't forget that marriage is one of the paths to citizenship, not to mention tax breaks.

Nurturing is clearly a part of our nature anyway, since it's a necessity for human survival. So trying to neatly divide the two is very difficult because it starts so early and humans will die in the absence of it.

878,t3_55vimx,"The Confucian philosopher Mengzi (Mencius) believed that human nature was essentially good. In support of this belief, he came up with this hypothetical: 

&gt; The reason why I say that all humans have hearts that are not unfeeling toward others is this. Suppose someone suddenly saw a child about to fall into a well: anyone in such a situation would have a feeling of alarm and compassion—not because one sought to get in good with the child's parents, not because one wanted fame among one's neighbors and friends, and not because one would dislike the sound of the child's cries. From this we can see that if one is without the feeling of compassion, one is not human. (Mengzi 2A6; Van Norden 2008, 46)

What he's saying is that, *when everything else is removed*, humans would rather do good than do bad. The examples you cite above are of people doing bad things because it is profitable for them - they get something out of it, whether it's money, power, sexual gratification, or something else. You're not comparing good vs. evil, you're comparing unprofitable good vs. profitable evil. And because humans naturally do have a selfish side (we wouldn't have survived this long if we didn't), the profitable vs. unprofitable debate will sometimes take precedence over the good vs. evil debate. That's why the Mengzi argument is so persuasive for me - when you remove all the baggage and reduce the problem to simply ""would I rather do right or wrong?"", it becomes pretty clear that most people would rather do right.

When I do this, the energy otherwise taken up by my fear-based, self-interested ego -- this energy becomes re-channeled.  From here, compassion and empathy emerge as the first sensory experience.

I started on a meditation path because I liked the ideas it talked about.  And yet I cannot explain why I experience a sense of deep caring in the practice.  I see through my thoughts, feelings, and behavior, and underneath, this deep caring is always there.  Even when we are acting violently, this deep caring underlies the experience, but unfortunately it is not fully realized and therefore not always channeled appropriately.

I don't ask that you believe me, but try a meditation or concentration-based practice and, if you are like me, you will find that pro-social feelings are the deeper truth of humans.  It's enough to almost make me a theist -- I am not; I tend to think this is something related to our primate programming.  I also believe that this is more of an expression of who we are when we are not giving into that part of our brain that endlessly fixates on threat avoidance.

So I have become an optimist because I have experienced and choose to continue experiencing the deep caring underlying all my experience.  As I continue to practice, these tendencies further filter into my daily life, so I am able to cultivate more consistent pro-social tendencies even in times of great difficulty.

Hate and violence sacrifice freedom and individuality even more than a healthy global community would.

200 years ago it was acceptable to rape women, beat your wife, lynch black people, beat gay men to death, murder indigenous people, own slaves and traffick children. People had a lot of ""freedom"" to do whatever they pleased, including the ""freedom"" to murder men and rape innocent women and children, who's going to stop them? Cops didn't exist until the mid-1800's. Before then, people were ""free"" to prey on people.

Living in a violent society severely limits individual freedom. Others have the freedom to rape or kill you at any time because this is the social norm in a violent society.

Difficult to say or do what you want when you have a government or a violent society threatening to kill you with even the slightest aberration from the norm.

107,t3_61zvnh,"We should first acknowledge that this is a cultural issue. If you come to many parts of Africa where everyone is black, even the suggestion that being called black would be an issue would seem non-sensible. (Keeping in mind Africa is a huuuge place and this is not the case in all of the continent). 

In America, however, racial divisions are more strained. The history of slavery and the subsequent oppression have led to ideas about fundamental inequalities based upon race. While this concept seems stupid to an educated liberal (who I assume are the majority of readers on this thread of Reddit), it should be understood that words like black and nigger have both been used as a derogatory word for the race as a whole. This has caused many people on the black-white spectrum to reject any association with being black, especially because being black has been considered worse than being Latino, Indian, or even just slightly less black. This was especially prevalent in many places in Central America.  

This means that in certain circumstances these words must be used with discretion, and context is everything. Calling people black may be an acceptable way to define people if they identify as black or if they don't care.

119,t3_61zvnh,"The difference between calling a person of African descent Black and a person of Native American descent Red is that the Native American knows her history.

The typical Native person is aware that she comes from a people who have essentially lost a war to retain their homeland. Everyone else knows it too.

The typical Afro person is not aware his history. We as a people are not conscious of the subtle cultural traits that have persisted in spite of attempts to wipe them out.  And because of these attempts, the cultural differences are sometimes subtle, too. So I think it is worth a special effort to remind ourselves, people within and without the Afro community, that there is such a thing as an African heritage that has influenced Afro-Jamaicans and Afro-Americans and Afro-Brazilians *in the same way.*

If language is about making yourself understood rather than trying to change what people think (which is a bit Orwellian for my tastes, even if it's well intentioned) then I'd be hard pressed to come up with an alternative, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be aware of the baggage and shortcomings inherent in the words we use.

95,t3_61zvnh,"The problem here is you're using a word that is loaded with negative connotations.

""Black"", ""brown"", ""red"", ""yellow"", ""white""--these words are not necessarily meant to hurt anyone but emphasizes the abstract division between **races** that oversimplifies the purpose of making such divisions. Worse, these divisions encourage a competition between the **races** where the ""whites"" are apparently winning for so long now. Saying ""black"" as is could be seen as something okay to do, but calling someone ""black"" to remind them of their inferiority is so common that every instance of the word black already sounds offensive regardless of meaning, and unless the competition, the discrimination is ended, the negative connotations would remain.

True, saying someone is African-American might not seem a bit accurate in terms of describing a person's **nationality** or **ethnicity** of which saying he's Jamaican or Latino would be more okay maybe, but African-American is a much better word than black, and gives a better view of what **race** your physical attributes suggest, not just your skin color, if you're describing someone's physical features.

But if your point is just to not offend people, that's subjective so ask the people you're describing if they're offended that you call them names.

Note: Caucasians not being offended by being called white does not in any way mean that african-americans should also not be offended. It is not double-standard. It's called perspective. It would even suggest that the caucasians indeed have a superiority on everyone else, such that ""black"" has become so offensive and ""white"" not.

85,t3_61zvnh,"These terms are out of date, but so is every other term. And we don't need new terms if people already understand what you mean by it. Its what terms are for.

Because their skin is not actually black. So that isn't accurate, its an assumed approximation of a standout skin tone. 
Neither are Caucasian peoples' skin are white. 

~~Technically to accompany proper terminology for Whites as Caucasian(Caucasoid) and for Asians its: Mongoloid. For Black people... its Negroid.~~ out of date, despite being 1:1 in modern continental grouping

~~Good luck calling someone a Negroid, as correct as it is. Even more correct than ""Black""~~

So with that logic people don't like correct speak anyways. Even if Black is correct(More-so than African-American)

Its not that it isn't perfectly fine from an objective standpoint. Its that people who DO have a problem with it are people who WANT to have a problem with it subjectively, whether it affects them directly or not.

They(those who have a problem with terminology) don't WANT you to be right. They want to arbitrarily decide what is right and when to get mad about it.

It would also depend if you, as assuming a White person could and would accept being called a European, specifically a European-American. If you would, then African-American WOULD be accurate, because while you don't identify as a European culturally, through heritage and genetics prove otherwise. But this mild accuracy leaves for more problems... like African-British and other nonsense.

Also why is black and white correct for European and African descent people, but not yellow for Asian?

79,t3_61zvnh,"When you get right down to it, the concept of race isn't a perfect way to describe what really exists.  Of course I understand the very human desire to create a socially-defined shortcut for an in-group or out-group.

113,t3_61zvnh,"&gt;People use African American (yes I'm from the USA), but a lot of the time that is inaccurate. I lived in a town with a significant Jamaican population. Teachers (trying to be as politically correct as possible) referred to them as African Americans. This angered my Jamaican friends (who had no issue with using the ambiguous term black) because they did not consider themselves African in the sligh

This is a misconception I see a lot on Reddit. The ""African"" in ""African American"" isn't referring to geography or nationality, it's referring to the African racial group (the other major ones being European/Caucasian and Asian). Black Jamaicans are of African racial descent, so if they're living in America they are indeed African Americans. On the other hand, a white person from South Africa living in America wouldn't be African American; they'd be Caucasian South African Americans. In this naming scheme, countries indicate nationality and continents are only used to identify race. 

I agree though that black isn't an offensive term, and I'd wager that's how almost everyone feels. I mean, how often was Barack Obama referred to as the first black president in mainstream media? There may be a tiny minority protesting the term but I wouldn't take them seriously.
