Google and Godaddy aren't hosting any websites. They're *domain registrars.* That means they let someone buy a URL (like Adobe.com) and have it point to an IP address. (like 192.147.130.204). An IP address is like a phone number, it lets your computer know which other computer to get the relevant information from. Anyone with a computer, an internet connection, and the technical know-how can host a website. They don't need permission from anybody, they don't need to agree to any terms of service, they don't need to anything.

We use domain names simply because they're easier to remember than IP addresses. And while you don't need to have someone's permission to set up your computer to show a website, you do need to go through a central authority to get a domain name.

That central Authority is [ICANN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN).

1125,t3_4g3nbn,"Harry Potter will kind of always be overrated to a certain group of people. People seem to have already argued the characters and writing, but I just want to put it in context. 

The first Harry Potter movie came out right as I was finishing 5th grade. It's a Young Adult genre story. Kid with a crappy life finds out he is actually part of this story that both happened and is currently happening. Especially if you watch the first two movies, they aren't spectacular stories, but man do they capture the imagination of kids. I still remember the first time Harry went to Hogwarts both in the books I read, and the movies I watched. I remember when I was sick for a week my mom would read the books to me until I feel asleep. 

Harry Potter is to my generation as say the 80's was to an older generation. If you weren't a part of it, you would say ""what the hell are they wearing, and what were you thinking?"" But they will say it was the greatest decade of their life. Right or wrong, you can't really rate someones life experience, and I wouldn't expect someone like my dad to understand why Harry Potter was so important to my generation. So the quality really isn't that important honestly, it's about nostalgia and representing a generations childhood. I am in no way a fanatic now that I am older, but whenever anyone brings it up, I think back to when I was a kid. 

If you go into a Young Adult genre movie/book and expect serious literature, you are probably in for a bad time. ",d2efish,CMV: Harry Potter is overrated,319,1,311,2022-04-29T15:08:01.110153Z,2022-04-29T15:08:01.110183Z,74.376,Historical

Is Harry Potter better than the Hunger Games or Dan Brown novels? It's more popular but the writing is not noteworthy in any of these books so really it's a popularity contest.

Harry to me is very average. He escapes a horrible home and comes into magical wonderland where he can literally do magic... and he's kind of lazy at it. He certainly doesn't impress anybody with his magic prowess, other than being very good with a broom. He can be petty, arrogant and bad tempered, disobeys orders and nearly gets people killed.

He's got a dark backstory but himself is a fairly average kind of person.

A Mary Sue (or Gary Stu, whatever) version of Harry would be something like this: he'd have a traumatic childhood with the Dursleys, until his entrance into Hogwarts. There he'd instantly become the center of attention, grasp every subject, have a harem of his own, and shortly into his time there would humiliate Snape in front of the entire school.

Not at all. Harry Potter is just an average hero. Sure, he has special traits that make him the main character of this story, but in everything else he's just average or below average. 

He's brave, but he's not smart. He constantly makes bad decisions that negatively affect his life and lives of people close to him. He often acts spontaneously with no regard for consequence or opinion of other people and that more often than not leads to something awful.

Ability wise, he's only average at everything but Quidditch which helps him with his depressing feelings. Most of his academic success he owes to his friends, specifically Hermione. He's decently good at battle magic, but only because that's what life was asking from him at the time and he was the only one at the school who had those terrifying experience.

He has attachment issues, anger issues, jealousy issues that are constantly shown throughout the series. He's kind of a big douche.

&gt;he does nothing

He successfully outsmarts and defeats Quirell/Voldemort in Year 1 despite being 11 years old.

He battles and defeats a giant Basilisk that nearly kills him in Year 2

He saves his godfather from hordes of most dangerous creatures in the world in Year 3

He successfully completes all Tri-wizard challenges in Year 3, despite being younger than other contestants.

Also, the writing reminds me of Roal dahl (Charlie and the chocolate factory), and or Narnia. But not as good and the language used in HP is fare more difficult to read for children.

But eventually, it's more personal, and about the characters. When reading the book I need to identify with the characters. And I can't identify with Harry. He always makes choices I wouldn't make and that I find stupid or wrong. And it goes the same for the other characters. I couldn't see myself being a friend of Harry or Hermione ever. (Ron maybe).

It is perfectly acceptable for something to not resonate with me, and there is no reason for me to denigrate that thing or anyone else's enjoyment of it.

Take Severus for example, he is a fantastic and brilliant character who brings a lot to the series. He is a great catalyst for hp and he brings an interesting view to the fold. He shows that devotion and loyalty truly are Harrys, and the series, defining characteristics.

Lupin, another large influence on hp with little recognition amongst this thread. He too, gives Harry a fair amount of personality in book 3 as a leading cause for the heroic path that Harry will inevitably partake in, and helping him confront that dark that he fears.

Lastly, I'll touch on Sirius. Among many hp fans he is the favorite. He leads the effort in elaborating on the conflict Harry continously endures, the loss of loved ones. He brings so much to the table for the series as a perspective that's recognizably the traits we appreciate from Harry: bravery, strength of will, and loyalty.

My point with all this is that the book is about Harry, but too much focus on him will obscure the rest of the denizens and what they bring.

I even met a Muslim-American where I live now in Korea a couple weeks after the election. She told me her daughters are scared to wear their headscarves at university. I told her my friends are worried they will lose their children or that they will get beaten up for using the bathroom. She held my hand and told me she'd pray for me and my friends. I wished her family well.

We want to make goals and run towards them without being constantly reminded that we don't belong in our own country. The LGBT community has so much in common with the Muslim community in America.

Your statistics are valid for a country as a whole, but it doesn't take into account the individual.

On average, you will be more likely to shoot/hurt yourself when you own a gun, but on an individual level, chances differ greatly between the schizophrenic nutjob who always carries and is quickly irritated and the guy who keeps it locked in a safe for emergencies separate from the ammunition.

Additionally, there is a game theorical problem at play here: Ofcourse the country is much safer if and when no one has a gun. But you cannot ensure that happening. Some people may break the ""social contract"" and acquire a gun to gain an advantage (that's why we need armed police forces! Edit: And once you have armed police/military forces, Americans will argue that you need armed citizens to prevent the forces from abusing their advantage) and once someone does, when in conflict, it's a strictly dominated strategy (= a disadvantage you cannot overcome) not to have a gun.

Guns are an equalizer. There are some elderly members of my family who carry guns (fully compliant with the law of our state). If someone tried to mug them, either with bare handed or with a knife, they wouldn't stand a chance on their own.

If you ban guns, that 18 year old guy is going to be pretty damn sure my 74 year old grandma isn't packing, which means there is very little physical risk to him mugging her. If it's legal to carry guns, he's going to think twice about whether that 74 year old lady is really worth it, and she doesn't even have to be carrying for the law to create those second thoughts. 

So back to the statistics you cited: sure gun violence goes down in places where guns are banned, but go look up statistics for other violent crimes correlating to gun control measures and you'll see that gun control doesn't make much difference for violence as a whole, and can even make certain populations easier targets.

Only one of those statistics has any meaning in the argument to restrict gun ownership, the overall homicide rate. The rest improperly separate shootings from other means of violence, while it is the total rate of that general form of violence that is important. Mass shootings are only a meaningful statistic as a portion of all mass murders.

Given that the non-gun homicide rate of the US is not comparable to the non-gun homicide rate of the other countries, the presence of a large contingent of gun-related homicides cannot be said to be extra. We could easily see the method change without a meaningful alteration in total homicide rate.

For the one honest statistic presented in your link to be convincing, it would need to demonstrate a relatively consistent non-gun homicide rate across many countries with and without gun restrictions, alongside a high gun homicide rate solely in countries with those restrictions. As the statistic is presented, it is quite clear that gun homicides are not an isolated variable in the comparison.

Guns are much the same.  

Despite having a shared tongue, religions, customs, etc, the UK is a fundamentally different country than the US, and comparing them on the basis of one variable (gun ownership) totally ignores wealth inequality, policing, education, rural/urban divide, and thousands more.   

Not having a ton of time to address all of them, I'll just look at one variable, population density. You can see that vast swaths of the US are doubly as rural as even the most remote tracts of the UK or France or even Germany.  When you talk of taking guns out of the hands of Americans on a national level, you must realize you're talking about people that are literally hours away from any sort of police force.  Having lived in Kansas personally, and driven through remote mountain passes, having a firearm suddenly *really* makes sense, if for nothing else but the comfort that you can confront various lethal threats independent of the nonexistent police force.  You start to look at it not as the tool of the murderer, but as any other tool, like a tire iron or flashlight (torch for you, I guess).  For these people living in the rural underbelly of the USA, that's all guns ever have been, and to suggest that they be curtailed due to the whims of the urbanites seems downright treacherous.

819,t3_6694ui,"Maybe I can appeal to your Libertarian side.  Think about all the other rights people have.  In America, we also have 4th Amendment rights against search and seizure.  If we got rid of this right, the police could search any private residence they wish, at any time.  If they did this in high crime neighborhoods, the crime rate, particularly the violent crime rate, would plummet.  And if you haven't done anything wrong, you have nothing to hide, right?

My point above is, just because there are less murders and crimes when you take away peoples freedoms, it doesn't necessarily make it a good thing. I'm sure there are very few violent crimes in North Korea, because they have no rights.  Freedom comes with a price.  Criminals of course can exploit these freedoms, but that's the price we pay to live in a free society.  The right for me to defend my family and property also allows criminals to commit violent crimes.  

The question you have to ask yourself is; why do you draw the line at guns and not at search and seizure, right to a fair trial, right to remain silent, etc...  Getting rid of any of these would have a much greater effect on crime reduction.

What this Internet setup should be used for in developing areas is to download educational materials: news, textbooks, PDFs, pictures, maps, etc etc  to be accessed on phones or other devices offline.

I mean, many of my age or at least a bit younger don't even try to manage on their own. They may have a job, but they still get hundreds of euros of benefits because, well, why not. Getting benefits is the norm, not an exception. I believe education and healthcare should be free though. 

What comes to automation, I don't think it will solve much of these issues. Human individual is always responsible of himself. If human will just become a lazy fucker who gets free money while robots do everything, he's just a burden because he contributes nothing.

Ultimately, the money/wealth to afford to do provide all these handouts was generated by the free market.
