Conservatives believe in a smaller government, which naturally means fewer government programs. This might sound bad at first, but let me ask you: have you ever known the government to be good at handling money? I barely trust them with my tax dollars to get things done. 

One thing most liberals fail to grasp about conservatives is we're not specifically against freedom and liberty for all. Quite the opposite. You're in control of your own destiny, and the options might not necessarily be clear if someone isn't in a great situation, but they're there. 

Let's take for example a couple lives on minimum wage working at walmart to support their family. Both husband and wife make whatever minimum wage is in their hypothetical town barely making ends meet. They feel stuck. But they're not stuck. They've just been conditioned to accept that they'll never get anywhere and THAT is the problem. Hypothetical family has every right to just go door to door and offer to do something like mowing the lawn for the neighborhood and make way more than minimum wage. Chances are, most families are willing to give 20$ to mow a lawn.

I’m not saying that there shouldn’t be a minimum wage, just that a minimum wage at $15 likely is too high. A recent [study from the University of Washington](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/02/seattles-minimum-wage-hike-may-have-cut-wages-and-jobs-study-author.html) found that low wage workers lost an average of $125 a month when the minimum wage was increased from $11 to $13 dollars an hour (although an earlier raise from $10 to $11 actually increased their earnings). Employers reacted by cutting hours and jobs, so the average low income worker was worse off. Now any policy that hurts the poor, I'd argue is counter productive and wrong. 

It's hard to apply this to the national level and there have been other studies that found contradictory results, but there is substantial evidence that conservative’s opposition to a $15 minimum wage may be better off for the working poor. More “conservative” policies like the earned income tax credit or universal basic income might be more effective at boosting wages for the working poor, but now I’m definitely getting into economics.

It is good to have all sides presented when faced with controversial issues of public importance.

Progressives tend to devolve marriage into a human invention malleable to the will of the masses without really considering what effects will come 2-3 generations down the road. Kids suffer from that.

I feel it may have been different if she didn't know what kind of wedding it was for, or if she didn't own the business (in which case she would have likely been fired). 

Also, you were saying in another comment that then a server at a restaurant shouldn't serve a few teens because they may think they'll have premarital sex... Two distinctions, the server probably doesn't own the business, and providing food doesn't directly contribute to premarital sex like, say, selling a condom does.  Providing food directly contributes to feeding them, and what they do afterwards is largely unrelated to service at a restaurant. 

For a Christian, it can be compared to owning a gun shop and selling a gun to someone who just told them they're about to kill someone. They believe someday they'll have to stand before God who will ask why they did that for them when they knew what it was for and when they believed it was wrong, like the gun shop owner would stand in front of the police/judge who would ask them the same question. Important to note is they believe a sin is a sin and all sins are equal in the sight of God (many Christians struggle putting that belief to action though, something I'm sure you've noticed).

We are given certain sanctified mysteries in our lives by God called sacraments. Among the most important of these sacraments is the sacrament of marriage between a man and a woman in order to procreate in fulfillment the commandment to ""go forth and multiply."" Additionally, we are commanded to do all things in love of our fellow human beings and for our love of God. The improper condoning or participating in sins is bad enough, but when we are called to condone or participate in something that perverts our sacrament is blasphemous and puts us in danger of Hell.

It is important to understand why gay relationships are sinful. Catholics (the original christian religion) values unity and being selfless. Being selfless is keeping nothing for oneself. Regarding to love and specially sex, being selfless strongly relates to fertility and nature: The objective is reproduction and any artificial attempts to prevent it are sinful: This include contraceptives, abortion, and homosexuality.

Cointraceptives are sinful because they prevent nature taking place. There's one exception to this, and they are the ""natural methods"", of which you can ask about in r/catholicism.

Abortion is a sin because it kills a human being (two when it goes wrong).

Homosexuality is a sin for the same reason contraceptives are: They have no other reason to exist than pleasure itself, and so can't be selfless.

Since marriage is the only way to get non-sinful sex, and it is supposed to lead to a natural family, the only marriage allowed is between a man and a woman. People who don't know about catholicism and fertility might argue that this excludes infertile people, but it is not so simple: Infertility is a wide range of fertility issues: You will rarely find a couple who has either 100% or 0% fertility. Also, it's an anomaly, and they might still conceive with a little help. Gay couples are always at 0% fertility, and this isn't an anomaly, but the rule.

According to the Catholic Church, all Catholics must get married in The Church.  We have a procedure for getting married, there are steps to follow, and they usually are, no problem.  So long as a Catholic gets married within The Church, there are no problems.  
  
Outside of The Church, people receive natural marriages.  To receive a natural marriage is not a sin, since the people receiving a natural marriage are not beholden to Catholic doctrine.  However, certain principles must be upheld in order for a natural marriage to be recognizable to a Catholic.  It must not end in divorce, or be the product of a divorce.  It must be of each party's own volition, and it must follow Natural Law.  
  
According to Catholics, and many Christians(as far as I know) the entire Universe is ordered to Natural Law.  Natural Law is basically is basically saying, ""God made the Universe *this* way, and He did it for a reason.""  Natural Law has something to say about everything.  Regarding sexuality, Natural Law states that human bodies are ordered to fit together a certain way, and that the natural result of that will eventually lead to new life.    
  
To go against Natural Law, according to Christianity, is a sin.  Christians are told not to support sins, and to instead provide help and support to individuals who are in a state of sin, because being in a state of sin means turning your back on God, and we don't want you to be in such a state any longer.

I don't feel that this is nearly as large of a hurdle as it is typically made out to be.

If you think about it in terms of business ownership, a structure which could easily be adopted for civil marriage, then traditional 2 person marriage is a just a simple partnership. Plural marriage is just a more complex incorporation. Even adding third of 4th people to an existing marriage is easily accommodated by adopting corporate law structures of ownership and liability. the trickiest to handle would be non-exclusive marriage, where one person could be married to two  people, each of which are not married to one another but also have separate spouses of their own that are not married to the center of the V that connects them all. I think that the only practical limitation to plural marriage lies somewhere in there - that it must be limited only to inclusive groups and exclusive to other marriage.

What do organizations (including the government) do with things like health benefits? The logistics become a lot more difficult, the potential for fraud raises substantially, the costs for everyone likely go up a lot, just to allow for what is a very very small segment of society.

And I think as a group, poly people still lacking one of the most important reasons we had for legalizing gay marriage. Gay people have been and still are massively oppressed. It is important that we as a society show that we support gay people and distance ourselves from a huuge history of violence, and belittling. While poly people may face some discrimination, I think a push to normalizae and support them just lacks the level of urgency and importance.

Marriage is recognized by the government because it is a benefit to the married and a benefit to society. Married people are a primary production method for more people, both with production of offspring and the transition from useless baby to functional adult. Generally this is better accomplished with two people rather than individuals. 

However there are other aspects to marriage's benefits: Married couples take care of eachother in old age, and generally establish some level of psychological wellbeing with eachother. This manifests with people being healthier and longer lived when their spouse is also alive. Another aspect of monogamy is that sexually transmitted diseases are not as easily spread because the sexual contact networks are less developed when most people are monogamous.

All of these benefits are called into question with polygamy: Sexual networks are more developed, allowing STDs to spread through a polygamist society more readily. The presence of multiple adults within the same unit skews power dynamics and may create disenfranchised parties within marriage units.

Because businesses are people too, and marriage is a useful financial tool for coupling assets. So denying business the right to do this, will give them financial losses that they could then sue the government for, then gaining some tax exception. So marriage as a business arrangement would have to be legal. That said, the two parties cannot be allowed to be bound by children.

If you are working on your second marriage, you have to make a choice as to who gets them, your divorced 1st spouse or your second, you can't have both of them benefit.  If you want to live polygamously, you're welcome to have as many consenting adults live under your roof and conduct things as you see fit. But as far as the legal recognition of marriage-you only get one spouse.

115,t3_6y8fi0,"We'll see if this counts as a CMV, as it's more aimed at shifting your perspective than outright changing your view. Basically, you're not wrong, but.

The argument for gay marriage you perhaps didn't consider is, ""It's justified because there's a whole heck of a lot of us currently who are in favor and want to get married /today/, and there's no equally sizable counter reason against it."" That's the argument that created a tidal wave of action.  That same stance doesn't exist for polygamy.

Sure, all the reasons why gay marriage should happen apply directly towards why Polygamy should happen, but it's not about all those reasons, ultimately. Those are primarily arguments to get more people onboard and overcome the, ""But we've always done it this way, why should we do something different right this instant? It's work, and different, and scary, and I don't like it!"" crowd.

Polygamy remains far enough outside of acceptable social norms that making the (difficult) change doesn't yet outweigh the inertial/difficulty hurdle of doing so.

So you're right, all the standard arguments for gay marriage apply, but there's one more less rational argument you may have missed: ""We want it."" which doesn't apply for polygamy.",dmm1ggb,CMV: The same arguments that justify gay marriage also justify polygamy,2271,1,1392,2022-05-19T15:11:53.690928Z,2022-05-19T15:11:53.690928Z,73.372,Other

We simply do not have the resources or manpower to thrive without the environment. We can't afford to match the oxygen output of vegetation. We don't have the time or energy to replicate an atmosphere capable of sustaining 7 billion (Jesus) people. We don't have the technology to manufacture soil for food or energy for all the toys we want. We can't supply man made coffee for the world, we need the trees and shit. 

Compelling humans to empathize with the critters with which we share earth is a foolish endeavor, because we are all selfish beings. I help people because it makes me happy.

He sees how these changes are not only a threat to the animals and plants, but to humans also.  He was a visionary of his time and so much of what he predicted has already come to pass.

However, the main issue I have with your logic would be that despite us shifting our focus away from Earth and towards colonization, there’s still the possibility that Earth becomes uninhabitable before we are able to harness the technology to support ourselves elsewhere. Who’s to say that we could do it in the next one hundred years? There’s no way to be one hundred percent positive that that will be a viable option for us by the time the Earth starts to be unlivable. If that happens, it would be almost impossible to backtrack. The Earth’s health is important, if only to buy us more time to advance ourselves as a civilization. On top of all of this, Earth is a beautiful place that many people care about, with living things other than humans on it.

Consider what means though - We are an apex predator. We became an apex predator in a environment which has an incredible diversity of plant and animals.  There are tons of things that can harm us, that are kept in check by other things that we harm. 

For example, in some places, people felt that since snakebites were a menace, they should kill all the snakes. The end result became that fields became overrun with mice, and harmed crops.

In other places such as Guam, humans introduced snakes into the environment. Now Guam has a snake infestation problem. Since the snakes are killing off the birds, it also has an insect infestation problem.

Finally, as you said, we should harness resources. But the diversity of plants and animals provides us with many of these resources. A lot of the traditional medicine in India is under threat since the herbs needed for it are being replaced by mechanized faming. 

You have far more mainstream examples of this. Bee colonies collapsing means we are slowly losing our source for honey.

17,t3_701fav,"Any technological advancement on the scale you speak of would in most cases only benefit a narrow elite.

Otherwise, by your rationale, once we colonise Mars we can just leave everyone else behind on a wrecked Earth on the basis that we have more chance of survival on Mars, so it is no longer worth saving those on Earth. 


Taking this position, our survival on Earth (and beyond) relies on us existing on Earth successfully. We need clean water to drink, clean air to breathe, clean land to live on and use for agriculture. We need Earth's biome to keep global warming from making the planet too hot to sustain life. We need the Earth's ozone layer intact to stop us getting fried by UV radiation. We need the Earth's sources to be sustainable, to provide materials for as long as we need them.

15,t3_701fav,"There has been a really prevalent idea that has become associated with environmentalism which is a misrepresentation. This idea is centered around the concept that the purpose of preserving nature is a benevolent one, *i.e.*, we should be preserving nature because it's beautiful, or it's God's creation, or that life is *inherently* important, and humanity should be protecting all life, or some other kind of non-sense. 

Really, environmentalism is about keeping the Earth from changing too drastically. Earth is an amazing place to live with all of environmental conditions necessary to support life as we know it. If we make massive changes to the Earth's environment, then humanity will suffer greatly because of it. The idea of colonizing Mars or another planet is *insanely* ambitious. If we try to colonize another planet before we can even effectively manage life and the climate of this one, we are going to be in for a really bad time. 

So I would posit that environmentalism is already about the longevity of the human race, there are just people who are part of that movement who don't fully understand that and instead try to make it about saving polar bears. If there are no people around to give a shit about polar bears, then nothing matters anyway.

For all we've learned, we still have no idea how life began. We don't know whether it was inevitable, given the right conditions, or an incredibly improbable and lucky event. 

We know the universe is full of planets. But so far we haven't found life anywhere else. As far as we know it takes a universe full of planets bouncing molecules against each other before one special combination kicks off everything else.

If life were common, we'd expect to see some evidence of alien civilizations. So far, we don't. But if only one planet has life, then that's necessarily the planet we live on. We could be the only planet in the universe with life, and everything would look exactly like it does right now. 

This planet full of life could be the jewel of the universe. And we're casually destroying it.

10,t3_701fav,"Other than the simple survival of the species, there are several other good reasons for protecting nature.

Protecting nature gives us variety. When the environment changes rapidly, many species will undoubtedly die out, and it will take millions of years for new species to diverge.  As species die out due to rapid environmental change, the species who survive/thrive are the ones which are geared to adapt quickly. These tend to be the small animals such as insects and rodents.  

Most people enjoy seeing a variety of plants and animals. It's aesthetically pleasing. 

Beyond aesthetics, [nature is often the inspiration of our technology](https://cosmosmagazine.com/technology/10-technologies-inspired-nature). We find a chemical or adaptation which gives the organism an advantage in nature, and then we figure a way to copy that same advantage for humans. The less natural variety, the less this is possible. With each species extinct, we risk losing the cure for cancer forever.

Without variety in nature, the world would be less aesthetically pleasing and technological progress would be slowed.

There are also health considerations. We may survive as a species when the air is not breathable, but we will have health problems. Also, there are health problems we may not see coming, such as when we used to include lead in gasoline, and as a result, we were slowly killing all life on earth (including ourselves) via lead poisoning.
