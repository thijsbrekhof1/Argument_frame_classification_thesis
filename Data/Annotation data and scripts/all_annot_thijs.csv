t3_42efvs,"&gt;I understand that this is an extremely controversial topic, and am expecting a torrent of downvotes.  

Not on reddit, being anti-Muslim is an extremely popular opinion here. Also, name a single society destroyed by Muslim immigrants. You can't, because it never happened.  

The same ""media"" that you think is biased towards accepting Muslims in Europe is always sensationalizing how bad things are. European society is not falling apart. Germans are not suddenly going to become a minority or overthrown in their own country. German culture won't be destroyed. There are nowhere near enough Muslim immigrants coming in to displace any part of European society.  

&gt;And then there's the other thing most people seem to be ignoring - the vast bulk of these people are not refugees. They're economic migrants. They stop being refuges once they arrive at the first country willing to receive them - which is not Germany, nor Sweden.  

What countries are they? The ones willing to receive them. Because it seems like more and more everyday they're being turned back from any country that's not Germany or other Western European nations. Why would they go to countries that are blocking them from entering? How does that make sense?",cz9rxia,CMV: Muslim immigrants are destroying every society that takes them in large numbers,1424,1,1437,2022-05-17T18:52:42.642256Z,2022-05-17T18:52:42.642285Z,1.089,
t3_42efvs,"This problem would exist with any mass migration regardless of group. It's magnified now with smartphones/youtube and social media capturing it as it happens. The group isn't the issue, the mass migration is.

Whenever you see a strong media narrative slanted against a group then you should ALWAYS be suspicious. Part of the media runs with whatever story is popular, the other part are shit stirrers or have an agenda. 

Also stuff like that swimming pool issue is small, Irish or Greek or Ukranian immigrants to NAmerica had similar practises you'd consider weird but they integrated over time. Stuff like that is not a reason to say ""incompatible"" whatever the hell that word means here. If you have an open society then you let people practise their practises as long as they aren't harming you. Once you start picking at their faults then it leads to hate which leads to.....

t3_42efvs,"The problem with your argument is the use of the following language:

&gt;  destroying every society that takes them in large numbers

It is absolute fact that the countries that have taken in Muslims in large numbers (which itself is an arbitrary statement - how much is large?) in most recent times have not been destroyed. Germany still exists. As does Sweden, Norway and Finland. Britain too.

Had you used more accurate language in your statement, e.g. ""eroding cultures"", then your argument might've survived a few more sentences.

I also take issue with your conflation of two terms: immigrants and refugees. Whilst a refugee is technically an immigrant, I feel that your argument of ""Europe is currently taking on hundreds of thousands of immigrants almost instantaneously"" is ignoring the reasoning behind the migration, which underpins the difficulties these people are experiencing adjusting to their new homes. Anyone migrating through Europe escaping ISIS or other regimes from the Middle East are likely doing so as refugees, seeking solitude in a safer country. That will naturally take some adjusting. Whereas the ""sizeable Muslim population"" you refer to that currently lives in Australia that has ""For the most parts, [...] integrate enough to function as part of Australian society"" have in the most part probably not migrated as refugees and certainly not under the circumstances as those currently.

The main issue is that EU is becoming something else than what we have in our heads. It is slow, large, bureaucratic and the way they drive the integration seemingly brings a lot of bad economical influence, see all the bailouts.

In the end I think, Europe should be unified in some form, it may not be the EU as it is now, UK leaving triggered other countries like France and Netherlands to consider leaving. This should trigger a wave of reforms in Eu and may turn out to be good for EU, and EU needs some serious reforms.

Since both UK and Europe needs each other, even though officially UK is not in EU now, they will maintain their influence, indirectly but they will. And vice versa. If they like what EU is offering they will do the same and they are free to ignore it and they are out of reach of EU court.

t3_4plwqq,"I voted Remain, but I'll try anyway.

The Eurozone has some structural issues caused by including poorer Southern European countries, and these have been part of the reason for things like the Greek debt crisis and high unemployment in Spain. If things go wrong big time in the Eurozone in the future, provided Britain has had time to orient its economy away from the EU towards the rest of the world, we might be better insulated from economic trouble in the Eurozone.

The other aspect is that the vast majority of elected politicians wanted to remain in the EU and will probably try to change the status quo with regard to trade, immigration, legislation as little as possible. I think things will be worse, but maybe not too different.

t3_6h7a4i,"The book psychocybernetics, which is actually mostly about the power of the mind over the body was written by a plastic surgeon. The intro to the book has him mentioning that sometimes people's perceptions don't change post-surgery. They still feel ugly. I think this leads to the uber-plastic surgery people like Michael Jackson. So in that sense, getting surgery might not be a good thing if it doesn't solve the inherent issue. 

Think of it as related to the phenomenon of attractive adults who were ugly kids. Everyone always mentions they don't act like the other attractive people. It's because they didn't adjust their mind to their new looks. That's the same thing w/ the plastic surgery. 

But, outside of that, there aren't too many reasons to be against it other than the fact that it's a surgery you don't NEED and with the rise of super bugs I'd rather not have surgery unless I need it.

In fact, it can leave them seriously deformed or even kill them.  Also worth considering is that some surgery doesn't age well.  So it might seem to improve your appearance in the near term (after the scars heal), but in a decade or two it might actually cause your appearance to look even less appealing than you think it already is.

t3_6h7a4i,"I totally agree with you that there is no issue with an individual getting plastic surgery. Your body, your choice. I think the reason people are against plastic surgery is because some feel the very definition of attractive is limited. 'Attractiveness' as we know it, generally encompasses certain traits like large eyes, straight nose, high cheekbones, full lips, wrinkle-free skin etc. And since most individuals do not fit this definition (or can't afford to), it seems unfair that the majority of people can't reach this ideal.  
  
  
  
The option of getting plastic surgery by a reputable surgeon is also only available to those with ample disposable income, so it is again limited. I honestly think the reason people are so against plastic surgery is because it is not accessible to everyone, and further divides the wealthy and non-wealthy.  
  
Finally, I would say most people don't like the idea of plastic surgery because people have egos. We do not want to think we need to change a part of our selves just to receive better treatment, and inherently those individuals are correct - we should be treated based on our character not on our looks.

This is one argument and I disagree, ""every way of life"" is relative. There are downsides to being very attractive, you focus on romance all the time and never have alone time. Ever realize how some very attractive people seem to be less intellectual, at least in terms of their character? That is at least a stereotype that is out there that could have an ounce of truth to it.

I agree that being attractive comes with social advantages, most of them very small and/or short term advantages. 

But it doesn't mean people who are less relatively ""attractive"" (how do you define that btw?) live a horrible existence, nor does it mean they don't have their own unique advantages.

This is a separate thought. There is nothing inherently ""wrong"" about it, regardless of your previous thought. 

There are advantages (possible help in social sphere of life, finding a partner, etc), and disadvantages (possible long term effects, can negatively change perception of appearance depending  on who's looking).

t3_4ph4lk,"I see several problems with this line of thinking.

First there is informational asymmetry.  What is reported as jobs that are in high in demand and therefore high in earnings yield, often has a delay from what is actually true on the ground. Or worse the actual numbers maybe intentionally suppressed.  As a result, in some fields there is a surplus in the labor supply and as a result pay and opportunities are lower than assumed.

Next, if you are looking to have a long term career in a given field, you are going to have a hard time being competitive against those who have 1) talent in the field and 2) proclivity toward the field.  The first part is actually less important (and potentially detrimental to some, for reasons I wont go into here), the second part is really important. Ones willingness to work harder in developing skills and talent in a given field is related to ones interest in working in that field. As a result promotions and better positions will be harder to achieve while burn-out in the field will be greater, if you don't have a proclivity.

Finally, given that labor markets are likely going to be increasingly unpredictable, if you are going the university choosing to include among your majors something that lends itself to making you adaptable or available to many markets is as important as specialized skills that may be in demand.

TLDR:

1)What appears to be needed now, may not be now or may not be when you finish.

t3_62igvv,"It can be very much the opposite. 

Education can indeed be a process of indoctrination. The sort of education that is useful to a person depends very much on their individual talents and intelligence. More and more often, as lower IQ people become more likely to attend university, people do not learn how to be useful until they obtain their first job and recieve on the job training. If they had a liberal arts degree, they may never get such a job...they will instead feed back into a system which acts as an echo chamber ivory tower of indoctrination.

People who are not so educated often need to be grounded in reality because they cannot afford not to be.

Illegals actually do take jobs from many americans and thinking otherwise simply suggests you are not properly educated. THat point is not really controversial among economists. But immigrants add more costs as well because they use public service and infrastructure.

Judging by the number of people with a gender/women's studies degree still believing the 23% wage gap to be real and caused by sexism that's not true for every college major.

&gt; A lot of conservative views tend to be based off of gut-instinct rather than a logical evaluation [..]

Interestingly that's an allegation conservatives also regularly make against left-leaning people.

&gt; For example, lowering taxes might sound good because it'll save the average American a little bit more money, but it'll cut budgets hugely for federal programs like educational grants, NASA, Medicare/Medicaid since the rich will save a ton of money.

That's a gross oversimplification. Both parties regularly push for some kind of lower taxes or another, but lowering all taxes equally isn't a talking point I've heard so far.

The need for advanced education is also highly dependent on your field.  Fields in which more people are liberal are often less practical, meaning you need more education because the goal is to become an academic.

Finally, there is more (a lot more) to government spending than ""either we spend money on good things or let the rich have more money"".  

It's probable that spending on higher education is a net-negative -- college was far cheaper when government was spending less on it and cared less about it.

Globally, it is usually families that care for the developmentally disabled. If that is true, then shouldn't that choice be left to the families?

Worse, these divisions encourage a competition between the **races** where the ""whites"" are apparently winning for so long now. Saying ""black"" as is could be seen as something okay to do, but calling someone ""black"" to remind them of their inferiority is so common that every instance of the word black already sounds offensive regardless of meaning, and unless the competition, the discrimination is ended, the negative connotations would remain.

True, saying someone is African-American might not seem a bit accurate in terms of describing a person's **nationality** or **ethnicity** of which saying he's Jamaican or Latino would be more okay maybe, but African-American is a much better word than black, and gives a better view of what **race** your physical attributes suggest, not just your skin color, if you're describing someone's physical features.

In America, however, racial divisions are more strained. The history of slavery and the subsequent oppression have led to ideas about fundamental inequalities based upon race.

t3_61zvnh,"&gt;People use African American (yes I'm from the USA), but a lot of the time that is inaccurate. I lived in a town with a significant Jamaican population. Teachers (trying to be as politically correct as possible) referred to them as African Americans. This angered my Jamaican friends (who had no issue with using the ambiguous term black) because they did not consider themselves African in the sligh

This is a misconception I see a lot on Reddit. The ""African"" in ""African American"" isn't referring to geography or nationality, it's referring to the African racial group (the other major ones being European/Caucasian and Asian). Black Jamaicans are of African racial descent, so if they're living in America they are indeed African Americans. On the other hand, a white person from South Africa living in America wouldn't be African American; they'd be Caucasian South African Americans. In this naming scheme, countries indicate nationality and continents are only used to identify race. 

I agree though that black isn't an offensive term, and I'd wager that's how almost everyone feels. I mean, how often was Barack Obama referred to as the first black president in mainstream media? There may be a tiny minority protesting the term but I wouldn't take them seriously.

Though this is where I differ from your opinion. Black isn't a race defining term. Anyone in Africa can be called black. Plenty of people in South America can be black. There is no more of a black race as there is an Asian race, or a European race.

Black, white, Asian, etc are physical descriptions. It is a broad term. Calling someone white tells you a general area of where their family comes from. But it isn't specific. I could tell you someone is black, but that does no more than narrow down the possible races.

t3_61zvnh,"The difference between calling a person of African descent Black and a person of Native American descent Red is that the Native American knows her history.

The typical Native person is aware that she comes from a people who have essentially lost a war to retain their homeland. Everyone else knows it too.

The typical Afro person is not aware his history. We as a people are not conscious of the subtle cultural traits that have persisted in spite of attempts to wipe them out.  And because of these attempts, the cultural differences are sometimes subtle, too. So I think it is worth a special effort to remind ourselves, people within and without the Afro community, that there is such a thing as an African heritage that has influenced Afro-Jamaicans and Afro-Americans and Afro-Brazilians *in the same way.* 

So in my opinion avoiding the word Black is like avoiding eating meat due to climate change. Sure, the world will not end if you don't, and sure, you will blend in with current culture better if you just say Black, but there is a perceptible moral high ground to avoiding it: bringing awareness to a relevant issue of our times. 

You can disagree with my moral argument in the same way you can disagree with vegetarianism, I'm not saying it's an absolute moral high ground. 

Let me also clarify that I don't believe that people with African origins should cling on to or exaggerate their heritage. Everyone will mix in the long run.

However with a unified currency, the exchange rate is based on the Eurozone as a whole. This means a strong economy like Germany gets to use the same exchange rate as Greece. Germany gets to use a weaker exchange rate and gets a huge export boost, while Greece is stuck with high exchange rates, high labor costs, and an noncompetitive economy.

Meanwhile, Northern Ireland also voted solidly towards remain, so they may either have a similar referendum, or there will be heavy emigration South.",d4maelz,CMV: Britain is royally screwed.,1324,1,1292,2022-05-15T13:19:25.413663Z,2022-05-15T13:19:25.413695Z,37.674,Economic
t3_4plwqq,"To give some context; I grew up in the south of England, in the home counties, an area that broadly voted remain. But now I have been living for some years in the North of England, in areas that overwhelmingly voted to Leave.

Living in the South is great, it is very rich, there is nothing wrong with the status quo, and things are generally lovely.

Living in the North is grim, really, really grim. I have lived in the city center's of Manchester and Sheffield and they are both very nice and spruced up with EU regional development funding, but once you start going out of the city center, into any of the suburbs or regional towns, things get very bad, very quickly. 

A huge majority of people have desperate, hard, lives. 
The collapse of the North (be it mining, manufacturing, fishing) and subsequent fall into a state of apathy and ignorance through a life that has been bred on dependence of social welfare is a failure of our democracy. The summer riots of 2011, benefit culture, and racism are the results of this failure.

In this referendum, these forgotten people *actually* had an chance to change the political establishment, and they did!

This was probably the last chance to end a sleepwalking political system that has neglected an entire class of our society. I had feared what would become if this situation had we remained unchanged, had our government and the EU not listened to these people.

I am apprehensive for the coming months, but overwhelmingly optimistic for the coming years.

Happy to talk more about it if you wish!

Markets hate political uncertainty and change. They love stability. This makes a thin win for the Leave the worst possibile scenario for the markets.

However, this is just a short term fluctuation. Effects of Brexit on the currency have to be evaluated in the medium-long term.

I am not saying the effect will be necessarily good, I am quite skeptical indeed, but this morning's 13% drop is quite irrelevant.

Also, should the pound remain weaker, consider that a weaker currency is good for your exports. Maybe EU countries will have to pay an import tariff to buy your goods, but it will be compensated by a cheaper price. And it's not even sure there will be a tariff, UK may still have an access to the EU market, like Switzerland has.

Like any other non-EU nation... Look, for centuries your country had an empire that - like the EU - imposed rules and regulations on it's colonies that prevented them from self-determination.

Say you have a cleft chin, some women hate it, others love it. You choose to get a chin implant/filler and the women who would normally disregard you for this feature would now suddenly go for you. Then, the woman has a child with you and the kid has a cleft chin, where did that come from? 

Of course, this is an extremely obscure example but it is used just for effect. Same with hair transplants, balding early may be a bad genetic sign to some women, as is a hooked nose, a double chin, dark under eyes, etc. 

I believe the best time to get cosmetic surgery is once you are in a committed relationship, so that you are changing you for you, and not to get a partner or to benefit others. The partner would be on board ideally, and already know how your genes looked originally. 

Cosmetic surgery is meant to make you and you alone happy, and feel more comfortable in your own skin, not to please others senses.

t3_6h7a4i,"I don't agree that having cosmetic surgery necessarily improves your looks.  In fact, I believe that in most cases the opposite is true.   I'lll hedge a little to start with--for someone who's horribly scarred or something, yeah, why not give it a shot?  In those cases it can legitimately help.

But I'd argue that most surgeries undertaken for purely *cosmetic* reasons fail on two fronts.  First, it doesn't work.  That face-stretching thing people get to hide wrinkles?  It doesn't make you look younger, it makes you look like you're in a wind tunnel.  The one where people get their lips injected with silicone sends the whole face straight into the [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley), at least for me.

Second, the fact that the poor bastard turned himself into a special effect (IMO) makes him look desperate.  That compounds any legitimate problems he/she might already have had with their looks.

As I got older and my hair started receding, I am completely happy buying some clippers and shaving it down to 1/16th of an inch once a week.  I have a nice, round head, and I think I look good compared to other people my age.

My coworker got transplant surgery, sports a full head of hair, and has to take a couple of pills every morning to keep things working.

This comes down to a personal choice for both of us.  To him, losing his hair was a big deal, to me, I'd rather not have to take pills if I don't have to, so it wasn't even a consideration.

We both have our ways of dealing with our flaws, and we both feel good about our choices.  If you want cosmetic surgery to make YOURSELF feel better about YOURSELF, it can be a big ego boost and help you in general, I've seen it change people for the better and can definitely be worth the investment.

But I would argue that it's possibly immoral and here's why, gonna try to keep this concise 

I think you're right that attractive people generally have easier lives than unattractive people. I think it's also (indisputably) true that people with more money also have easier lives. Plastic surgery is expensive, thus the only people who can get it are those with the means to do so. Meaning that plastic surgery will only enhance the lives of those who already have a better life than those who can't afford it. Therefore, normalizing plastic surgery creates a further divide in the quality of life between the (for lack of a better term) poor and ugly and the more affluent and beautiful (whether natural or not).

So in conclusion, I definitely think plastic surgery is beneficial for your own self interest. However for society as a whole, it seems at best neutral (CMV?) and at worst detrimental by widening the ""quality of life"" gap between the poor and the (relatively) affluent, and therefore isn't moral

TL;DR people who can afford plastic surgery already have a better quality of life than those who can't --&gt; normalizing plastic surgery could result in more inequality --&gt; plastic surgery is amoral at best but arguably immoral   ",diwmr69,"CMV: apart from very specific circumstances, attractive people have a huge advantage over unattractive people in every way of life, therefore I see nothing wrong with getting cosmetic surgery to make myself look better",1271,1,1244,2022-05-14T13:22:59.755358Z,2022-05-14T13:22:59.755391Z,65.268,Morality

I often feel like people are let down or act weird around me when they realize my personality doesn't match what they anticipated based on my looks.  Of course, there is a lot of personal bias here, just one guy's opinion.  

On another note, being good looking has made me more superficial.

What, exactly, *is* attractive?

Maybe! Am I really? ... Maybe? To some, quite hideous. To others, sexy as hell. I personally consider myself to be quite attractive. Certainly doesn't seem to help get me a career.

&gt; there is no moral wrong in somebody getting cosmetic surgery to enhance their appearance as it allows people to live a more fulfilling life where they are treated with more respect than if they didn’t get cosmetic surgery.

In essence, you are asking if it's morally wrong to voluntarily damage the body in order to achieve some personal goal, and I think we could include body piercings and tattoos to achieve some sort of outward appearance, anabolic steroid use to achieve some physical goal, etc. And yes, these all involve damage to the body and health risks, and in rare cases, death.

Assuming they have low self-esteem before surgery and feel happy with themselves for the first time ever after surgery, I'd imagine they'd suffer from bad depression after having a kid that is ugly realizing it was all a sham. And they'd have to deal with those feelings of inadequacy from their ugly children until the day they are old enough to get surgery etc...Assuming they can survive that long without any detrimental effects, the parent.

For example, being an attractive female in a professional work environment can be  a considerable disadvantage, especially if your coworkers and/or supervisors are predominately female as well.  I have seen many female coworkers judge other female coworkers by saying they got a promotion ect. specifically because they were attractive, not because of their merits as a worker. I have also seen coworkers being accused of sleeping with the boss, ect. to get promotions, simply because they were attractive or because of how they dressed.  I would argue that females who are attractive are judged more on that, and presumed to be less competent by other females than their unattractive or average coworkers. 

I have however found that in a predominately male environment, being an attractive member of the opposite sex may have a temporary advantage. I say temporary, because when competing against other less attractive female coworkers I feel that I may have a slight advantage, however when competing against other male coworkers I may have a slight disadvantage if the boss only sees my physical appearance and sees my male counter-parts intelligence.

Ultimately, Muslims are just like any other group of people in the world. Some of them are religious nutjobs, but most of them are pretty chill people. So really think about where your view is coming from. Have you ever talked to a Muslim in person, or at all? Do you have personal experience? Or is this just based on fear? How is this any different from when evangelical Christians who have never spoken to a homosexual are afraid that gay people are going to recruit their kids? Or that they can't properly raise children so they shouldn't adopt? If you look up old op-eds and newspaper articles, they had polls and statistics that looked very similar to yours to back up their views too.

No one discriminates because they are inherently evil people. They always do it because they are afraid. In almost every circumstance, being welcoming has worked out in people's favor.

Some immigrants are, in fact, escaping the very same prejudices (in there case violence and death) to be in an open minded, accepting community. What you'll be doing is counter intuitive.

t3_6ihcuk,"&gt; Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance.

There is a point at which no life exists, right? And there is a point at which a life definitely exists, right?

That means without a doubt that there must also be a point at which the non-life becomes a life.

It's not a matter of there being *impossible* to decide when life begins, it's that we can't agree on when it is.

So I reject your notion that ""any dividing line is pointless,"" there absolutely is an answer, we just all need to agree on it.

Personally, I've decided that I'm not knowledgeable about the science behind it to decide when a fetus (or group of cells, or whatever) becomes functional enough to become considered a living being worthy of rights, but doctors are. As with most things, I put my trust in those more knowledgeable than I am who use the science involved in measuring something to tell me the answer.

And their answer is after one trimester. (or more accurately, that's the point at which we can be sure)

Now, you can disagree with me that that's the most accurate time, (you'd be basing your decision off emotion, not science, but that's up to you) but that doesn't mean it's arbitrary or wrong.

There is absolutely, 100% a point at which a non-life becomes a life, the issue is not everyone agrees on when that point is. But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. That just means the question is, should we base it on what knowledgeable doctors who study the science tell us it should be, or an emotional response?

I'm not saying this to be a devil's advocate but because a large population believes it to be true both religiously and politically.  If you're a true Catholic for example birth control is a form of abortion.  

There exists a minority handmaiden-like belief that if a woman isn't trying to conceive with her husband each month she's not following god's will and essentially robbing him of new followers.

Actually this has been defined quite clearly for many centuries.  They called it ""the quickening"" and it was when the developing fetus *starts to move* on its own.  Any time before that the woman could ""cure"" herself of her illness with whatever herbal concoctions were available.   It is only in the recent disease that is called ""western culture"" that a woman's control over her body has been barbarically seized by the government.

Definitions of personhood aren't arbitrary or up to technology or chance. A common definition of personhood used by the ""pro-life""-movement is that personhood is simply a human life and thus starts at conception. There is nothing up to chance with that definition. 

Another commonly used definition of personhood is based around the notion of self-awareness. In this case, not even infants would be considered persons, since self awareness takes a while a develop. Importantly, this definition means that we should also treat animals with self awareness (apes, whales etc) as persons and grant them fundamental rights.  

In either case, I don't believe personhood is relevant to the abortion debate.

No one on the pro-choice side has ever claimed that a fetus isn't human, clearly it is. The question has always been whether or not it's a person.

And I'll note that the religious right in America has only **VERY** recently come to the conclusion that personhood begins at conception.

Christianity Today, the flagship magazine of the Evangelical Right, was publishing articles immediately after Roe praising the decision as morally and religiously correct. Books on Christian ethics published up until around 1975 were in near universal agreement that ensoulment didn't take place until late in a pregnancy or even at the moment of birth, and that therefore abortion was not a moral issue except for those Evil Catholics (and everyone knows Catholics are't really Christians).

It wasn't until the late 1970's that the religious right suddenly switched to believing that abortion was the ultimate evil, and that switch didn't fully complete until the early 1980's.

What confuses the matter is that the American right never admitted that it changed its mind, or examined why it did. Instead the right has chosen to pretend that nothing changed and that they were always anti-abortion.

I think your ""we don't care much about human life"" argument is a non-starter though.

&gt;The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes ""a person"" is pointless.

It's not at all pointless.

There's more to this issue than human life-if it's not a human life than it's part of a woman's body.

So if it's a life it's a murder issue, if it's not then it's a women's rights issue.

I think that this is why abortion is one of if not the most difficult political issues. To a person who feels that life begins at conception a pro-choicer is a endorsing murder. To a person who disagrees the pro-lifer is violating a woman's right to her own body.


&gt;That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.

We weigh risk versus reward.

So let's throw out speed limits and abortion and look at the concept of fighting.

We allow sports like MMA and boxing because the risk of injury, while high, can be offset by regulations and standards.

We don't allow pistol duels, however, because the risk shoots up beyond a point where regulations can properly control.

So higher speed limits assume risk but we offset that with safety technology, vehicle inspection, DWI laws and police presence.

We can't control for risk in an abortion. The risk is very nearly 100%-the goal is to end the pregnancy.

Now I'm pro choice so obviously I don't take the pro life view. But I don't believe that the comparison you're making really helps the debate-very few people would endorse activity that guarantees the death of a child.

Therefore, to legislate the answers to these questions is to violate an individual's religious freedom. Abortion is a religious question, not a legal one.

t3_6ihcuk,"Few people think that what matters in abortion is whether the fetus is ""human"". It's a mundane fact that a fetus is just a human at the fetal stage of life, just like a corpse is human at the ""dead"" stage. Personhood is pointed to as a morally significant category, in contrast to the less significant category of ""human"", because persons are the principal objects of moral focus. Breaking a rock doesn't matter much unless it matters to people, and breaking a person in half matters precisely because it's a person we're breaking in half.

I'm pro-choice myself but I think the move away from ""personhood"" ignores a central concern. What's more crucial is whether a fetus's personhood (or lack thereof) matters *enough* to outweigh the other interests at stake. If a fetus isn't a person then it's not much of an issue. If it is a person then we've got to weigh the value of that fact against the other concerns in the situation.

Even back then the US wasn't very free. Democracy existed for a long time before that. Civil rights existed before that with the Bill of Rights 1689, the Magna Carta and France expanded civil rights with their Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen a lot more than the US did. France even abolished slavery in 1794... granted it was reintroduced under Napoleon. But it was than abolished in the 1840's, a full 20 years before the US.

Voting was restricted to white landowning males for a long time for example. And New Zealand, Finland, Australia, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Hungary, Sweden, Netherlands, Canada, Germany all had female suffrage before the US. And technically the US did not achieve full and complete universal suffrage until 1965 with the abolition of poll taxes which was used to disenfranchise minorities. 


The US abolished slavery nearly 30 years after the British Empire did for example and after the French Empire. Mexico abolished slavery before the US.

That is true, to an extent.

I'm interested to hear what kind of rhetoric you are referring to at the end of your post. And, why should we not be proud to be part of a developed first-world country, even if other countries have caught up?

Why can't we celebrate that other European nations have also achieved higher levels of freedom rather than self-degrade ourselves for not advancing as fast as them?

Once you reach a certain level of freedoms it tends to plateau, meaning that there isn't as much you can really do to improve and, while I agree that there are places to improve in our current system, it simply won't increase as fast as other less-developed nations, and that isn't something to be ashamed of.

One example is that my family must repair their own roads when river flooding washes out bridges. Similarly neighbors coordinate together to fight wildfires. Dealing with these issues requires cooperation usually because no single family owns the necessary capital (e.g. specialized tools and vehicles) to completely fix the problem, and this defines a community of mutual interdependence, but no interest in the nominal government.

As I am aware, this is not a thing in USA, but very much a basic freedom here in Nordic countries. If there is a forest or a hill, you are allowed to go there and stay. No one will threaten to shoot you for doing so.

You can absolutely do this in the US. Most US states have large areas set aside as public lands and parks. You can generally hunt, hike, camp, watch birds, fish, pick mushrooms and berries, and so on.

Once I failed out of school and was between jobs and I said to myself...Im going to take a month off from life and just drink as much beer as I want (12 pack a day or more) and watch baseball on TV and allow myself to use alcohol to temporarily feel better.

It worked.  After a month I started looking for work in earnest and decades later I kinda look fondly back on that time.  It was the right thing to do at that time....I was about 35

Here is the 'limit'.  I dont drink at all anymore because I dont like it anymore.  The hangovers become more destructive in your 40's.  Your liver cant take it.  You dont really notice it at the time but you are killing yourself quite quickly. Take a selfie and see how you're looking.  A bit beefy and pale?  bad skin?....imagine what your insides look like. 

I learned I dont even like the buzz of alcohol.  It is so predictable.  30 minutes of euphoria followed by a craving to drink more to maintain it or either clawing irritation or bad sleep.  It is good to mess with if you want to learn to release your inhibited character quickly and never have before, but if you are not careful you mistake the juice with your natural character and begin to build an unhealthy association quickly.

Just give it a rest after a few months.  If you see you can't you know you have a problem.   Get another job or change your life in some other meaningful way soon.

Drinking is awesome. There are great beers, wines, and liquors to try before your life is over. I would guess that booze now is the best it's ever been in the history of man, and it's only getting better. If handled right, it will be an amazing compliment to experiences for the rest of your life (a great red with a badass cut of meat, a glass of champagne to toast a special occasion (or to crank up and oj with brunch), a bourbon while sitting next to a fireplace on a cold night, a microbrew to drink while watching a movie or hanging out at a pub, a Pina colada to cool you down at the beach, etc.). You don't even need other people for those things if you don't want!

However, if you burn out on trash beer now (and likely progress to shitty cheap liquor), you'll never get to *enjoy* the better stuff. You'll end up drinking until you physically need it, you die, or you have to quit altogether. All of those are fucking terrible.

Third, you won't be able to maintain the level of drinking you are craving while homeless.

On treatment, there are some amazing treatments that do wonders.  There are anti-anxiety meds that give the same relaxing type relief that alcohol does without all the side effects.  There are anti-depressants that give a bit of a different type of relief, but can yield the same result. They take the edge off pain or stress.

18 months ago she was diagnosed with stage 4 bilio-pancreatic cancer, which had already moved to her liver.  She started chemo, which basically made her unable to keep any food down.  Switching meds helped for a while, but then it'd happen again.  She dropped from just over 200 lbs, to around 85 lbs over that time.

She died last week, after suffering what we think was a stroke in the early morning. She lived for 2 days after that happened. Unable to speak, chew, swallow, or anything of that nature she passed away.

Drinking is only cheaper than therapy in a monetary sense... until you consider chemo therapy, hospital visits and other medical expenses. Don't do that to yourself dude.

One argument that might change your view has to do with affective forecasting - our ability to predict how we will feel in the future. Basically, we're not very good at it. So, regardless of how confident you feel about your future, it's possible that your life (dating, job, social life, how you feel) will get better. Other folks have pretty well covered the evidence that heavy alcohol use leads to diminishing returns, mood-wise. So, it's possible that the things causing you to drink won't be as bad as you predict, and that drinking won't be as good as you predict.

As an alternative, light drinking and/or light use of weed seem like decent options.

I get where you're coming from. I do about the same thing, 8-10 light beers 3-4 times per week. And it is great! 

But as someone that used to drink 60+ per week and has spent the last year struggling to get down to a more reasonable amount I strongly recommend you do NOT get in the habit.

If you drink that much you will gain a ton of weight. You will feel like shit whenever you're not drinking. You'll be tired. Your stomach will hurt all the time. You'll have a lot of headaches. This constant hangover will effect your work and sober life negatively. You'll barely have enough energy to stay awake, let alone deal with people's bullshit.

I'm not going to tell you to stop drinking or cut back drastically. But if you drink more than you are now you will eventually regret it. And cutting back your drinking is a lot fucking harder than never drinking that heavily in the first place.

I dunno if you can get weed, but I find a little smoking and a 6 pack of regular beer or 8 light beers makes you feel great. 8-10 per night is still a little too high to maintain for years.

Money spent on alcohol may be cheaper than therapy, but the cost of down time being drunk and incapable of growth, career wise or otherwise, far outweighs the benefits of choosing perpetual intoxication over a sober life.

The relief alcohol provides is fickle. You talk about dopamine being released while drinking but fail to acknowledge cortisol and other metabolic and hormonal chemicals that completely screw you up when out of balance, particularly when that imbalance comes from substance abuse. 

Perpetual intoxication is a full time job. Alcoholics and other addicts can't keep jobs. 

The peace you seek will not be found in perpetual intoxication, because perpetual intoxication is a myth. You gotta come down sometime...and then you'll just be stuck with yourself again. Why not address the issue first? That way when you come down, you're ok with what you come back to. 

Hell is real and it lives at the bottom of a bottle.

All of this is experiential. You don't understand what the path you've chosen leads to. You'll go down it because you are me. Just remember that because of that, there's hope and unconditional acceptance to be found. Sobriety bests all intoxication and you can have it too.

t3_6vhdnm,"Its a lonely life. From my experience of [way too much] social drinking, in the long run it'll leave you empty and 5-10 years down the road you'll try to figure out what you have to show for your time. With nothing coming to mind, you might turn back to the only thing that never let you down, alcohol. Endless loop that leads to.....

Here's my suggestion, when it gets to be too much, exercise. Punch a punching bag or ride your bike. By the end you'll work off a ton of stress, release a shitload of endorphins, and have nothing in your brain but how your muscles hurt. Plus in the long run you're getting fit for the next girl and/or all those cute tinderellas out there! Instead of running through your liver like it's on sale, you'll actually be getting healthier.

At the end of the day I'm just suggesting to find distractions besides only booze; booze is fun and all, but you should only use it when you're in a good mindset. Exercise is the best IMO, but if that's not you join a club or something. The worst thing is to just sit around thinking about how much life sucks; that's an endless rabbit hole (see video below). I know it's hard but you have to find something good to focus on to kick ass at.

You’re drinking enough to build up a really really high tolerance. Eventually the alcohol will not work like it used to and your brain will physically start to produce less dopamine with that level of consumption. 

This means that the mental issues your trying to bandaid will get worse over time. That said, you’re not going to notice the slow gradual change because you’re too drunk to notice. You’ll notice when it’s too late. As hard as you think things used to be, recovery is 10x harder. 

Keep an eye out for withdrawal symptoms. These are going to be a sign that things have really gotten bad.  
- “Hangovers” that are cured by consuming more alcohol. 
- Shaking / sweating / nausea... feeling like you’re getting “food poisoning” more often. 
- Gastritis. Shitting more. Having frequent diarrhea. 
- Rapid are labored heart rate.

Given the amount you’re drinking, and given that you have a day on and a day off, you should also be careful about seizures. Read up on these. They are very real and can kill you. When you do stop, don’t go cold turkey. Dial down over a few weeks or get medical help to avoid DT seizures.

Not good at making friends?  With hard work, guided by therapy this can be fixed and eventually you can stop going to therapy.

With drinking, as soon as you sober up your problems are still there.  If drinking is going to be your coping mechanism you must do it forever.  You can't ever stop because once you do your problems come back.

However we are equally American. My point here being that there isn't a cut and dry definition of American culture and by extension, no cut and dry definition of what makes you an American aside from the obvious,  having citizenship. 

One thing that makes America great is the various cultures. The Midwest was largely settled by Germanic and Scandanavian peoples so the culture reflects that. Texas largely settled by Mexicans and Spaniards but we have areas with large German and Czech populations. 

Your racial identity isn't what makes you American as much as your citizenship does. Your accent doesn't matter as I have a very different accent from my cousins and we are all american. Your skin color doesn't as I am darker than some cousins, lighter than others but we are equally American. Your political views don't make you American as you can tell just by viewing Reddit that there is a plethora of views in this country.

They are vegetables, they have no personality, they cannot do anything for themselves. They sit in a chair and moan all day. The mother has given up her entire existence and hundreds and thousands of tax dollars is spent keeping this person alive. They are loved, and they are people, and I enjoyed meeting them and knowing them, but I think they are alive because when they were born it was to taboo to abort/euthanise.

But these people are the very very small minority of disabilities. I met many, many people who fit your description - cannot walk, talk, communicate, eat etc by themselves, but you can see the person and personality they are. There's little more special than thinking an individual is like the above, then watching their face as their mum walks in the room and seeing how much love they give. How they giggle at certain things that make them laugh, enjoy certain movies or like being tickled. 

What is the line here of humanity? How much humanity is necessary to justify existence?

t3_61gkuk,"The main danger l see with this is the potential for murder. In general, most humane civilised people, whom are not suffering from a psychological disorder that numbs their apathetic emotions, will agree that a innocent life taken without consent by another human is murder. 
Since we can not ask (or know) what humans with certain limiting conditions want, we can not make a life or death judgement. 
I'd suggest the most humane civilised approach is the one we currently have in the more civilised countries. We do our best for these people.And hopefully as research on genetics etc improves so will the situation.

However, it's worth bearing in mind that being humane is something that society has evolved towards. And arguably caring for our sick is the most humane activity any human can do.

There's a common illusion at work here. The illusion that nobody ever changes their mind on the internet.

The people I argued with about religion have absolutely no clue what an impact they had on my worldview in both the short and long term.  They probably came away thinking their efforts had been in vain. Because I was much too proud to say that I was wrong. And I was also fighting an internal battle as well. I had been convinced but my emotions were still trying to fight with my mind.

I think it's a funny kind of arrogance that you see here and elsewhere on reddit. Subscribers to this premise are basically saying,  ""well, I may have the capacity and wisdom to change my mind in light of evidence and reason but trying to convince other people is just pointless.""

If you need proof that minds can change, look no further than the rise of atheism/agnosticism since the invention of the internet. That's what happens when people have an anonymous outlet for debate and discussion where they can talk about these things with no risk to their reputation or social standing.

t3_44w1wn,"&gt;Like the title says, I think that most Bernie supporters are selfish and want to live in some dreamworld without caring at all about, or very well even realizing, what it's costing *everyone*.

Arguably just as important as what it costs everyone is what it would save everyone.

Medical costs are the single biggest cause of bankruptcy in the US.  Universal HealthCare would eliminate that

Low-wage workers rely on government support programs, which are paid for by taxpayers. So taxpayers are subsidizing the low wage. A higher minimum wage would level that out

&gt;The majority of Bernie supporters are young, in their early-mid 20s. I am 24 years old myself. The vast majority of young adults my age do not make a lot of money. Because of this, why would they give a shit about tax brackets? 

I'm 24, currently in a STEM position, already well into the 28% tax bracket. I have no student loan debt, company-sponsored healthcare, and a small-but-growing amount of investments. When I support Bernie, it's not for personal gain, but for the benefit that I believe he'll bring to this country and the people in it

&gt;Households that make $250,000+ stand to get shredded by these tax rates. It doesn't matter if they can afford it. They shouldn't have to give away half of their household income. 

Marginal tax rate means that to actually end up giving away half of your income in income taxes, your salary would need to be well above $250k. If you're making above $250k and not expecting to see your tax rate increase, then you're living in your own version of a dreamworld.

t3_44w1wn,"A huge problem in America right now is wealth disparity. Lowering the financial burden of college doesn't lessen the the amount of knowledge learned or how rigorous an achievement is. It simply allows smart, hardworking people who otherwise couldn't not afford higher education to get educated in a field of their choosing. If anything, increasing the amount of people who are able to go to college would increase competion. This would cause getting into a good program to be more impressive than otherwise.

Likewise, most Bernie Sanders' supporters don't want everyone to make the same wage. Innovators, business owners and employees that have large stress/workload demands will still get paid significantly more than the unskilled worker. However, by narrowing this gap you open the options for many hardworking people to succeed. That person who works two jobs to stay afloat and cant afford the money nor time to get a degree in their passion might be able to quit one job to go back to school part time. Those families who weren't fortunate enough to come from a rich past wont have to worry as much about if they can pay their rent or if they can give their children a childhood they think they deserve. Plus they would be able to spend more money which would be reinvested in the economy.

I think the reason that the younger generation speaks the loudest in a need for change is because they are firsthand experiencing these struggles that their parents and especially their grandparents never had to contend with on this scale. Being the main victims of certain problems does not inherently make the desire to address these problem selfish, as these issues are a widespread issue supported with facts rather than just a personal frustration.

Most of the very rich were born that way and there are whole industries designed to keep them that way. People who have recently become upper class generally have the deck stacked in their favor and didn't have that far to climb to make it to that upper echelon. 

The fact of the matter is there is far less social mobility, that is ; ability to improve ones circumstances, in America than in other parts of the world. Poverty has become a trap, not because people are lazy and refuse to work, but because work, especially labor, is no longer paid enough to secure a comfortable life.

I don't think the 1% contribute to society in any real or tangible way, and in fact exploit and leech from the rest of the world. 

To bring it back to your comment I am responding to, in light of recent events, I don't see how you can think the very wealthy had any personal stake or took any risk where they stood the slightest chance of bearing any responsibility or incur any personal loss.

Are you aware of the strong correlation of wealth across generations?  How rich your parents are is a strong predictor of how rich you'll be.  That's definitely not ""risk"". Same with parents wealth correlating with college graduation etc.

Relatedly, most people are never in a position to even reasonably take that kind of risk. You can if your parents are supporting you.  But if you're working long hours to help the family pay the bills starting on your 16th birthday, it's not a reasonable option.  That has little to do with hard work.  It's an accident of birth.  

Also, the types of jobs which pay YUGE amounts aren't always correlated with providing the most gain to society.  Finance is important but a lot of people also make tons of money and don't help society much.  The way the government and tax system and all that are set up are part of why this has happened, and even if it weren't we can reasonably decide as a society to change this.

t3_44w1wn,"First off I don't agree with a bunch of Bernie Sander's economic policies. However I think your arguments against them are not great.

- Even under Bernie Sander's tax plan, the wealthy will still make a significant amount of income. Furthermore the more money they make before taxes, the more they will have after taxes, so they will still have profit motive. (Albeit not as high as before.) They are still allowed to make money, as they deserve.

- The economy is not a zero-sum game. There are not a fixed number of jobs available for any given degree. Lifting others up does not mean others have to sink. Also improving the overall education of the population is a net positive. Complaining that your education will be relatively less valuable is ironically pretty selfish. It'd be like a high school graduate complaining about free government-funded high schools.

- I think you are confusing marginal and average tax rates. A family making $250,000 wouldn't have to pay 50% on all their income, only on additional income. Many places have a top marginal income tax rate of 50% and wealthy families are not ""shredded"" by them.

So I see from other comments that you do actually understand how marginal tax rates work so this statement is misleading. Even if the top marginal tax rate was 50%, you would have to make about $10 million per year before your income was effectively halved.

t3_5y8e43,"You might be interested in a firsthand account of what it's like to have a transgender child, and how early they express their views. One of these accounts was recently on [The Moth radio hour](https://beta.prx.org/stories/191431) (start around 36:30), in which a father describes what his transgender (ftm) child was like around kindergarten. The child had never liked wearing dresses or other girly things, but for the first few years the father just attributed that to the kid emulating his older brother. By the time he was 4 or 5 years old, though, he was saying things like ""God made a mistake"" and ""Can you take me to God so He can put me in the right body?"" I think that's a pretty profound thing for a kid to say at that age. and these views did not change year after year after year. It's pretty clear that these things are tied to a person's identity from a _very_ early age, and it's pretty clear when it's just a phase and when it's an actual part of the child's identity.

You mention the problems transgender people have with depression and suicide, but I think you've misattributed the cause. My understanding is that they're depressed because the people around them don't accept their preferred gender, and they commit suicide because they don't want to live life as the gender they were assigned at birth. If the communities they lived in would just accept their preferred gender, these people would not have higher rates of depression or suicide.

How did you reach that conclusion? I have no experience with feeling that my body is the wrong gender; do you? If transgender people are saying they experience this at a younger age, who are you to question it? The state of being transgender isn't a decision that comes from consideration of facts. It's just something you experience.

This kind of argument used to be popular for sexual orientation. I never decided to be straight or gay, but I knew which gender I was interested in at a young age. How is being transgender any different?

&gt; This is problematic because the transgender community faces discrimination, mental health issues (depression, suicide, etc), and generally more problems than someone who isn't transgender.

Many of the mental health issues stem from experiencing gender dysphoria. What you are proposing makes the situation *worse* since you want to prolong that experience by not accepting their decision.

Mathematical *concepts* were indeed invented.  But actual mathematics isn't the concepts; it's the relationships between them.  For example, you have to invent a lot of concepts to even be able to say 2 + 3, but however you get to those concepts, however you imagine sets of constant cardinality to be, whether numbers count things or measure things or weigh things or whatever you imagine, you will *always* get 5.

You can say 1+1=2 in every language on earth, and it will sound different each time. It might be written differently, but it all refers to a fundamental notion of addition. We can invent any system of words and writing to describe it, but it all refers back to a fundamental natural law. 

With relatively simple concepts like 1+1=2 or the notion of 0, it is easy to say that we invented it because basic arithmetic and algebra rarely translate into actions and reactions that we see in physics experiments. However, once you start to understand more advanced concepts and the progression humanity has made in describing the world around us, you can see mathematics start to more closely resemble the experiments we use to understand the world. 

The eternal goal of mathematics is to provide a unified theory of mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc., and we can recognize that even current models are not perfect. In the future, we might even have a whole new system of notation that makes learning and understanding the underlying mathematics simple. However, we can see that even with the current, imperfect models, that we can make predictions regarding chemical reactions, quantum behavior, etc. that translate into hi-tech products and processes.

t3_4ph4lk,"I feel like it's difficult to argue against you, because of your stipulation ""...I don't believe in choosing the best paying major out there, but the best paying major that you have a little interest in.""

What, exactly, determines ""little interest""? I have a little interest in cars, but I don't think that means I should suddenly pursue becoming a mechanic because I think cars are neat and heavy duty mechanics make a decent wage. Essentially, I think most people have *at least* a little interest in nearly every discipline out there. Using that logic, I would then, according to your stipulation, necessarily pick the highest paying alternative. 

I also think you're not considering the vastness and depth of the job market. Many disciplines cross paths. For example, business and sociology. Many of things we learn in sociology (and even psychology, etc.) directly correlate with things we learn in business.  One could take either a business or a sociology degree and focus on one particular usage. Instead of focusing on the job market, I think what you're really concerned with is how people *perceive* particular degrees. As a business student, I can tell you that much of what I've learned in my first year classes wasn't nearly as relevant as some things I learned in my first year sociology class. It's all about how you use the information. It's not all about the degree, but how you use the information to benefit your position. 

TL;DR - Society's perception of particular degrees influences how useful we think the information in. It's not necessarily the degree's fault, or what an individual is learning from the courses found in it, but instead a problem with societal perception of usefulness. Also, what constitutes ""a little interest""?

I am a very fast and easy learner, and I enjoy almost everything I learn. As a gamer, I at first thought that a computer engineering degree would be great, and would be compatible with my hobbies.

Entering my senior year of high school, I find myself to actually be taking a massively different path. I spent lots of time learning music theory, exploring different forms of performing arts, and overall enjoying myself. I've taken instrumental music (although that is where it started), dance, theater, and will be also doing choir. Meanwhile, I've taken up composition and history research projects that have expanded my skills as a musician.

While a computer engineering degree would definitely pay out better and still be very compatible with me, I find myself also finding a very heavy preference to composition and conducting at the moment. As much as it pays out less for no different interest value, I find that there is a sentimental value with my experience as a musician.

In my life (or anyone's life), i need a certain amount of happiness. If i do a job i like only a little, it gives me only a little happiness. That's not enough for me, i want to enjoy life more. So, i would need to do activities or outings to be happier. Those cost money. So, the happier i want to be, the more it will cost me. Money comes in from the job, and goes out for activities. 

If i have a job that i really enjoy (which is currently my case), after my 8 hour day, i had a lot of fun. I enjoyed my day. At the end of the week, i don't need to go out and do anything to be happier, i already enjoyed my week. I may have made a bit less, but i don't need to spend anything as a result so it's not such a big difference. Not only that, but i work side jobs in my field on my spare time. Since i love my job, it makes me even happier to go out and work, while making even more money. So in the end, I'm being paid to have fun on my time off that i spend with friends. 

Not to mention the fact that i love my job means im always looking for new ways to improve my work, always willing and eager to learn. It makes me very valuable to employers.

A major that closely aligns with your strengths and skills - and you should be very good at those skills. With this strategy, you will be in the top percentile of your chosen academic field and your future professional field.

I feel that any field can be high paying - just that in some fields, the top percentile make a lot of money, but then it falls off very steeply if you are just mediocre or even above average. Fine arts would be an example, I guess.

I also feel that one derives true enjoyment and satisfaction by excelling in a given task. It is that high level of performance that gives us positive reinforcement, releases endorphins and makes us feel good about ourselves and about our lives and our work/education.

My theory is that there is nothing intrinsic in a given field that makes us love it. What we love instead are the specific tasks and actions that we perform when immersed in that field. And we love those tasks not because there is anything special about it, but because we are really good at it, so we feel good about ourselves when we excel in those tasks.

So we attribute this to this warm fuzzy notion that we ""like"" or ""love"" something, or that it is our ""passion"".

Also your argument should consider public and private schools differently. Public education, as a tax-payer funded enterprise, has been pushed for in most of the state constitutions, at least on a K-12 level, to be a form of civic education. If primary and secondary education are supposed to give students the ability and knowledge base to evaluate complex arguments, such as presented in a jury trial, or policy stances, as may be encountered in elections,or, even, to keep the government accountable by appealing to traditions of normative political thought, as activists do, then that's all the more reason to encourage that civic mission in public colleges as well. Politically-relevant knowledge is, to a large extent, going to be found in the social sciences and in the humanities more so than in high-paying majors. Not that someone studying high-earning majors wouldn't contribute to politics,but, at the same time, a vocationalist outlook on the purpose of an education tends to conflict with the civic purpose.

Most people work and live around people with similar attitudes as they, and if they do encounter other opinions, they have no real reason to confront them, and those opinions aren't usually very thorough. 

Only on college campuses do you find the entire range of opinions, and you find them thoroughly fleshed out. That's because these kids care more, and go out of their way to figure out all of the details.

t3_4xsg8k,"You're entire view is a big fat strawman. The notion of a safe space is not some intellectual lockbox where only the prevailing viewpoint is allowed to be discussed.

Safe spaces are specific locations and times where certain groups can meet and hold discussions without fear of outsiders interrupting, belittling experiences, mocking, or in general being dicks. Alcoholics Anonymous, for instance, is a safe space. You are not welcome to walk in and offer people whisky or call the attendees weak willed or whatever. Similarly, a club for African Americans might have expectations that students do not walk in and say that, for instance, black males are to blame for police shootings, or that perceived microaggressions are just some form of victim complex, *regardless of whatever justification or statistics one might have*.

A classroom (the school grounds in general) is *not* a safe space. You still don't have the right to *harass* others, but opinions are debatable and facts are interpretable.

People don't want to have their interests shit on for a long period of time. This can also help people feel more comfortable expressing their interests and being who they are, whether it's a race, gender or otherwise marginalized group. Heck there's not even anything wrong with making a club about how great it is to be a white man; much of the hatred comes from the radicalization and centuries of history where those groups abused that power. 

Safe spaces applied to an entire place, especially those forced upon people, really do have good intentions. They want students to feel accepted, even when those abrasive people are barricading or shushing. However, it's the mass censorship of ideas against universal acceptance, the radicalization and stupidity on both ends that make it worse. It's awful that this concept has turned into either ""if you don't follow my rules you're a bigoted asshole who deserves to die"" or ""if you don't listen to me then you're a fucking bitch who can't handle negative comments.

If you ban guns, that 18 year old guy is going to be pretty damn sure my 74 year old grandma isn't packing, which means there is very little physical risk to him mugging her. If it's legal to carry guns, he's going to think twice about whether that 74 year old lady is really worth it, and she doesn't even have to be carrying for the law to create those second thoughts.

If there is a government takeover/dictator in America no one can keep them in check. Germany isn't going to do shit. Russia won't do shit. China won't do shit. They would all get rolled over by our military. This dictator would have the power to take over the world and enslave/genocide anyone they want.

So who is preventing this American government takeover/dictator? American citizens with guns.

The second amendment and guns have one real main purpose. To rebel against a government takeover.

t3_6694ui,"I'll preface by saying that I agree with your sentiment, so this is devil's advocate. I do think there is some argument here though:

Your statistics are valid for a country as a whole, but it doesn't take into account the individual. The necessity of a gun differs greatly between a 2m tall man who lives in an upper-class suburb and is good friends with everybody and a 1,40m woman who has an abusive, agressive (ex-)boyfriend living in a ghetto.
On average, you will be more likely to shoot/hurt yourself when you own a gun, but on an individual level, chances differ greatly between the schizophrenic nutjob who always carries and is quickly irritated and the guy who keeps it locked in a safe for emergencies separate from the ammunition.

Additionally, there is a game theorical problem at play here: Ofcourse the country is much safer if and when no one has a gun. But you cannot ensure that happening. Some people may break the ""social contract"" and acquire a gun to gain an advantage (that's why we need armed police forces! Edit: And once you have armed police/military forces, Americans will argue that you need armed citizens to prevent the forces from abusing their advantage) and once someone does, when in conflict, it's a strictly dominated strategy (= a disadvantage you cannot overcome) not to have a gun.

First, over 50% of the US owns legal fire-arms. Secondly, 70-80%+ of total gun deaths in most states are from suicide. Now, I imagine you're worried about murder rates. Look at them in context. 70%+ of all gun murders happen in major city ghettos and are being perpetrated by black gang members killing other blacks, with **illegal** weapons in specific demographics. Example: Like 90%+ of the entire state of Illinois murders come from Chicago. If this demographic didn't exist, gun violence would be almost non-existent in the US.

There's also a difference in major city gun ownership and urban/rural America. Gun ownership is basically a way of life in rural states. There's major focus on hunting and ranging. They also happen to be the largest percent of gun owners, while also having the lowest amount of gun murders. In fact, almost non-existent.

You can see that vast swaths of the US are doubly as rural as even the most remote tracts of the UK or France or even Germany.  When you talk of taking guns out of the hands of Americans on a national level, you must realize you're talking about people that are literally hours away from any sort of police force.  Having lived in Kansas personally, and driven through remote mountain passes, having a firearm suddenly *really* makes sense, if for nothing else but the comfort that you can confront various lethal threats independent of the nonexistent police force.  You start to look at it not as the tool of the murderer, but as any other tool, like a tire iron or flashlight (torch for you, I guess).  For these people living in the rural underbelly of the USA, that's all guns ever have been, and to suggest that they be curtailed due to the whims of the urbanites seems downright treacherous.

The center for Immigration Studies released data that there is no major job types that are majority immigrant. This means that illegal immigrants ARE competing for the same jobs that native born americans are, not sectioning themselves into these mythical ""jobs that Americans won't do"" category.

Furthermore you shouldn't assume that formal education is such a strong factor in how critically people think or why people vote a certain way. The divide between conservative and liberal views is probably more based on self interest than one side being dumb and the other ""educated"". Rural voters tend to be conservative and they are affected more by immigrants competing for jobs, have less diversity(therefore tend to have less interest in civil rights, social justice issues} and tend to benefit less from taxes, as public works and services are more concentrated in cities.

The best example of both sides critically thinking yet voting differently due to environment is gun control. Areas(large cities) with high concentrations of liberal voters tend to live in more populated areas and tend to typically have the benefit of police showing up quickly in response to crimes and also are more likely to notice irresponsible gun use(gang violence etc.) On the flip side a conservative voter in a rural area might see more value in keeping guns around because police wouldn't be able to respond fast enough if their house was broken into, and due to being in a rural area they see more utility to the use of guns for hunting.

So really voting is more a matter of issues affecting people differently and therefore coming to different conclusions on what policy should be.

Also, if being liberal is correlated to higher education, then higher education is correlated to being an anti-vacciner and consuming homeopathic medication, as that is correlated more with liberals. That's a sign college isn't teaching them to think critically.

Higher education is correlated with higher income. Within a given state, a higher income is correlated with conservatism (the richer you get within your city/state, the more likely you are to be a conservative). That automatically contradicts your statement.

What he also demonstrates is that most of our values are not based on reason. Reason exists to *justify* the values inherent within us (a lot of which are genetic). Morality comes first.

Religious voters aren't *really* ""conservative"" in the usual sense, though their is some overlap. Mostly, smart conservatives in the Republican Party have duped dumb people into voting for them... Many, many, Republicans are *socially* conservative, but would be more accurately called fiscally liberal (voting for larger government for defense spending, or to prop up the failing industries they used to have jobs in, for example). They've just been convinced that these social issues are massively more important than how they feel about fiscal policy.

t3_62igvv,"I think you're making a fundamental error in approaching this from the perspective of ""validity"" rather than competing values.  Most disputed political issues come down not to a question of fact or logic, but rather a question of balancing opposing values that have been brought into conflict.

Broadly speaking (although I'm sure some people will still quibble with me on these), conservative values center on tradition, personal freedom, and personal responsibility, while liberals tend to prioritize egalitarianism, community, and challenging the status quo.  Importantly, neither group has an exclusive claim to their values; almost everyone agrees that all of these are good things.  The difference between the groups is how they *prioritize* these values.

There are a number of experiences that are very common in higher education (regardless of focus) that can lead people to reconsider the relative value that they place on each of these.  

For example:

1) College is often the first time young people are significantly exposed to diverse racial and ethnic groups or LGBTQ people.

2) College is often a student's first serious exposure to the social sciences, which complicate the narrative of personal choice with powerful social, psychological, and political forces.

3) Universities explicitly foster a spirit of inquiry and the questioning of orthodoxy, which can challenge people who prioritize respect for tradition as a core value.

Crucially, though, none of these experiences *invalidate* conservative values.  It is not a question of liberals being right and conservatives being wrong.

t3_62igvv,"An illustrative example: I went to a good university in the UK and, whilst I was there, it was fashionable to own [bright red trousers](http://lookatmyfuckingredtrousers.blogspot.co.uk/). As a consequence, it was more likely that those with a university education in that part of the country would be wearing red trousers. It does not, however, follow that red trousers are a more intelligent choice of clothing. It is simply the case that the demographic in which red trousers became popular was coincidentally a demographic of university-educated people. Moreover, wearing red trousers became a way of *signalling* your membership in that demographic.  

This example is obviously not directly comparable to your point of view, but I think it serves to illustrate a point. The demographic of college-educated people may hold certain views or find certain things fashionable even though these views are not directly caused by their being college educated. 

More generally your argument suffers from some correlation to causation inferences. That just because having a degree is correlated to holding certain view-points, it follows that those view-points are caused by having a degree. The full picture is usually vastly more complicated than that.

But what if the 7:00pm arrival is late?  Now there's 10 people trying to get on the 9:00pm flight, so at least 5 people are going to have to wait until tomorrow.  And maybe tomorrow is fully booked so they're screwed.  
  
But is there a solution to this?  Yes!  Overbook EVERYONE on the 8:00pm flight so that flight is 5 seats overbooked and the 9:00pm flight is underbooked.  When the first flight is late, the 7:10pm arrivers get on the 8:00pm flight and the 7:00pm plane that actually arrived at 8:10pm gets its passengers on the later flight.  And EVERYONE gets to Alaska that day because overbooking saved the day.
  
Of course this usually means 5 people will get bumped from the 8:00pm flight to the 9:00pm flight.  Most likely they'll find volunteers to do it for $150.  But that's totally fine.  
  
In other words, overbooking actually helps everyone get to their destination as quickly as possible.  It also reduces fares and emissions because there's fewer empty seats and fewer planes in the air per passenger.",dg8xipj,CMV: Overbooking should be illegal.,537,1,525,2022-05-11T11:32:16.909608Z,2022-05-11T11:32:16.909635Z,46.118,Quality of Life

t3_64kkxe,"I see that your view has already been changed, but I thought I'd chime in with some additional info regarding flyer's rights in the US.  According to the US Department of Transport, there are two kinds of acceptable ""bumping"" from overbooked flights: voluntary and involuntary.  Voluntary bumping is the most frequent type, and this is what you normally see when the airline offers you incentives to voluntarily take a later flight.  Carriers are given a lot of freedom in how they negotiate with passengers in order to get volunteers, but it is frequently in the carrier's interest to get volunteers.  This is due to the regulations around involuntary bumping.  

Involuntary bumping requires the airline to arrange alternative travel arrangements that get the customer to their intended destination within 1 hour of their original scheduled arrival time.  If the customer arrives between 1 and 2 hours late, the carrier is forced to pay significant penalties to the customer for the inconvenience.  Any more than 2 hours incurs a 400% penalty that the carrier must pay to the customer.  This is all to protect the customer from overzealous overbooking.  The official rules are a bit more nuanced than my synopsis, and you can read them in their entirety here: https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights

So while overbooking can be problematic, I don't think it should necessarily be illegal.  The rules set out by the US DOT offer more than adequate protection for the customer while also allowing the carrier to fill all of their seats through informed overbooking.",dg3cm1o,CMV: Overbooking should be illegal.,532,1,520,2022-05-11T11:21:10.086218Z,2022-05-11T11:21:10.086244Z,392.822,Capacity and resources
t3_64kkxe,"If consumers laws didn't force the airlines to refund/reimburse/accommodate no shows, than there would be much less justification to allow overbooking. 

The FAA/DOT/non-US agency rules for overbooking were meant to allow the airlines to operate at a reasonable profit/ticket price while also giving customer rights and protections.

You can argue the carrot/stick balance the regulator struck needs to be changed, and that the implications aren't so sever for the airlines, but I assume there was a basically valid attempt to balance the public need for ailines to exist, low airfare, and money-back guarantee.

 Edit: US DOT 24hr rule for free cancellation/change for all ticekts.       
&gt;If you are booking an airfare in the United States, U.S. Department of Transportation regulations require that, as long as you've booked a non-refundable ticket 7 days ahead of your flight, you're entitled to hold your reservation and the fare and change or cancel your reservation within 24 hours of booking, without paying a cancellation fee (typically $200 on the remaining large ""network"" carriers for a domestic fare, but much more (up to $450 for some international fares), a bit less on other airlines, as this chart shows.

&gt;You can either cancel the reservation entirely, or change it, within the 24-hour window. If you change it however, a fare difference may apply, but there is no change penalty. This applies not just to U.S.-based airlines, but any airline selling airfares in the U.S.

Airlines overbook flights because they expect a certain number of people to miss those flights. This way, the plane is still mostly full of paying customers.

t3_64kkxe,"Is it fraud if there is no intention to defraud the alleged victim?  
Overbooking is in most cases a victimless crime. That is to say, in most cases, even though flights are overbooked, nobody has to leave the plane.  
The amount of overbooking is a carefully calculated number. Over the whole airlines know how many people are not going to show up to their flight.  
Have a flight of X passengers at date and time Y to destination Z an airline will know that (for example) 4 people on average aren't going to show up. Either being delayed, or cancelling or whatever reason.  
Now an airline has a choice, they can book to capacity, and wind up with 4 unsold tickets. This means that the airline eats the loss of those tickets, if they do this structurally, they'll have to find some way to recoup the losses. Perhaps by raising ticket prices in general.  
So if everything goes according to plan, everyone who arrives at the airport will be able to get on the plane, and everybody's happy, and they get to enjoy their cheap(er) tickets.

And this is of course the situations that the airline can control.  
There's things like bad weather (headwind), people bringing more luggage then expected, priority passengers and things like that.

I suspect the answer is ""yes"" just by the fact that you have placed such a high value on morality. I will also assume you think your SO is at least a decent person.

Lets also assume that competence and morality are not completely independent of genetics, as the evidence available suggests a mix of ""nature"" and ""nurture"" in human behavior.

As you're at least a decent person, and so is your partner, doesn't it stand to reason that you have a decent chance of having a biological child together that carries ""decent person"" genes?

If nothing else, you are contributing your tendency or capability to evaluate advanced ethics to the general human genetic pool. Many people have kids without even asking such questions.

If you believe that you should not have biological offspring, then you must also accept  the premise that you are not a decent person or your offspring will not be.

t3_58t7i3,"Well, your view seems to be based on the idea that overpopulation is a significant issue, so I'll challenge that:

In industrialized nations, overpopulation is effectively a non-issue. Most actually have a fertility rate well below the replacement rate; in some countries, like Japan and Italy, this is gradually becoming a demographic crisis. In countries with low birth rates, the high average age of the population means that eventually, there will not be a large enough working age population to support the post-working age population. This is already what would be the case in Europe if it weren't for immigration providing an influx of working-age people. Many governments have had to take action on this crisis, especially Japan, which has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, has a drastically decreasing population, and will have a majority of its population over 65 by 2060.

So, in reality, you don't have to worry all that much about the impact of bringing a child into the world. Take steps to reduce your children's footprint, and you'll be fine.

Each is an enclosed room of its own, with a door facing the open air. There is a solid brick wall between each single room facility and each contains a toilet, a wash basin, a sanitary bin and often a baby-changing station.

That said, the unisex-for-all has several advantages I would like to suggest:

- Will break down cultural stigma over a generation or two (no immediate help, granted, but maybe future generations could benefit the same as we look back on past anachronisms).
- Will equalize treatment of the sexes (excepting urinals) where regardless of gender (birth or identity), the same queue exists for all.
- Will allow positive bystander effects as well as negative ones (e.g. you will increase the likelihood of encountering people who won't stand for other people being bullied). As new facilities will be larger and servicing twice the traffic, they will be more likely to have witnesses and discourage praying on somebody alone.

&gt;Solution: make all bathrooms unisex.

I don't want to pee next to heterosexual men (and the more I live as a reasonably attractive girl the less comfortable I am with that idea) and I believe there is at least some advantage to segregating facilities based on perceived sex.

As a cis woman, I have felt discomfort using unisex bathrooms. But when I think about it, the only basis for my discomfort was 'it's unusual'. The bathrooms are all stalls, so there's no risk of being exposed to unwanted genitalia. I am no more isolated or in danger than I would be passing through a corridor or in some barely-used stock cupboard, and we don't segregate those by gender.

Sometimes bathrooms are places where you go to sort out clothes or make up. I can go in a stall if I need to change and there's no reason to be uncomfortable with a guy seeing me touch up my foundation.

There is no real negative effect on me for being in the same bathroom as a guy, which means I need to get over my discomfort.

We want to provide everyone equal access to comfortable, private means of elimination and attending to various hygeine problems. Okay. Here's my practical solution:


 1) Don't legally bar anyone from any bathroom. Yes that technically makes them unisex which you seem to mind, but I am not stopping there 


 2) Do require a minimum standard of privacy in bathroom stalls. Seriously. Half-inch gaps (or bigger!) in the stall doors are disturbingly common, as are woefully inadequate partitions. Unisex bathrooms are unappealing primarily for this reason. You should not be able to look above, below, or around the privacy barrier of a toilet. Period. 


3) Continue to provide bathrooms with urinals as well as without. Mark them as such: instead of men's and women's, use a toilet and sink icon, or toilet + urinal + sink.

Because we could never code an AGI totally by ourselves from the ground up (theres wayyyy too much going on) the most promising way to reach AGI is to build a series of ANI's connected by neural networks that can research AI, edit it's own code, and learn from its mistakes/successes. We would have a program that can make itself smarter. The smarter it got, the better it would get at making itself smarter - the growth would be exponential.

I'm an engineer, not a scientist nor a great thinker.  When I program a micro-controller or logic device, I am relying on a long series of abstractions to make it functional.  I have a rudimentary understanding of physics (which, in itself, relies on thousands of abstractions), a decent understanding of analog electronic, and a deep understanding of digital electronics.  Using that chain, I can create something new with only specialized learning in the area in which I am working.

It's not just that we advance in understanding, we also learn to set up shortcuts to learning how to gain that practical understanding. 

We do this in all areas of technology. Instead of needing to learn how to wire an entire building we color code the wires and terminals. Instead of needing to know how to create dovetail joints we buy our furniture at IKEA. 

We even build machines to find shortcuts for the shortcuts...

t3_4dat5a,"This is going to be fairly simplistic, but useful. Imagine human knowledge as a circle.

Previously, humans learned very general things. You can imagine the total knowledge as a circle with a small radii representing depth and the interior of an arc as the breadth of the individuals knowledge. The breadth of knowledge was necessary as food shortages forced any one member into a variety of roles. As advancements in food came about, individuals were able to specialize and gain more knowledge in any one field while sacrificing knowledge in other fields. This can be represented as the circle of human knowledge expanding while the individual's slice becoming smaller. As humans become more and more specialized due to a larger and larger food surplus driving population growth, a given individual will be able to continually expand human knowledge, while knowing a lesser breadth.

So while human knowledge expansion may slow down, the limiting factor is not the knowledge itself but food surplus. It the rate of human growth slows down, then knowledge expansion will slow down but not until then.

t3_4dat5a,"This is a relatively simple point, but I think it is also worth noting that specialization has a role to play in combating the knowledge overload problem. 

Medicine is perhaps the most obvious example of information overload; it's impossible for a single physician to treat every possible disease state or even know how to go about proper diagnosis and initial management; rather they know when they don't know the answer and refer to colleagues with different specializations. We've gone from ""Doctors vs. Surgeons"" to separating out even individual fields into subspecialties (like interventional radiologist vs. diagnostic radiologist vs. interventional neuroradiologist).

I think medicine disciplines are somewhat unique because that knowledge needs to be active knowledge; you can't rely on the internet for near-instantaneous access, you need to know it, confidently, in the moment, so it's a better way of assessing whether individual humans are getting knowledge overload.

So the solution is not longer and longer training times (although we are seeing that to some degree), but rather more branch points within training, and becoming more specialized. This is obviously enhanced by the fact that the professors themselves are becoming more specialized.

I'm not in academics, but I think that a similar process is likely occurring there; you aren't a chemist any more, you are a quantum chemist or a thermodynamic modeling chemist or a macromolecular organic chemist.

Having been through the public education system I would argue that the majority of student time is spent performing useless tasks that ultimately did not contribute to their understanding of some crucial subject matter. Already, the rise of the internet has made a huge difference in dropping the learning curve for some serious subject matter. This has made it possible for teenagers to make it to Silicon Valley, and ingenuity to come from unlikely places. There is still a huge room for advancement in the fields of education, and who knows what kinds of advances will improve this system?

Currently, the process of becoming an expert in a field who is able to contribute meaningful research to its development requires about 20-25 years of education. Of those, only 5-10 are spent studying material that is directly pertinent to that field. We can definitely do better in this regard. A restructuring of K-12 curriculum to eliminate waste and introduce important emerging fields could be one of the first steps towards this end. Better methods to absorb and retain information could exponentially decrease the amount of time spent learning, and thus completely negate or even reverse the effects you mentioned.

Google and Godaddy aren't hosting any websites. They're *domain registrars.* That means they let someone buy a URL (like Adobe.com) and have it point to an IP address. (like 192.147.130.204). An IP address is like a phone number, it lets your computer know which other computer to get the relevant information from. Anyone with a computer, an internet connection, and the technical know-how can host a website. They don't need permission from anybody, they don't need to agree to any terms of service, they don't need to anything.

We use domain names simply because they're easier to remember than IP addresses. And while you don't need to have someone's permission to set up your computer to show a website, you do need to go through a central authority to get a domain name.

That central Authority is [ICANN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN).

t3_4g3nbn,"Harry Potter is perfectly accurately rated in as much as those who like the books like them, those who do not like them do not, and those that are indifferent remain indifferent.

I'm one of the third group. I've read the series in it's entirety. I wasn't particularly impressed, but was mildly entertained. More than anything I found the books were far better at triggering my memories of having read much better books when I was at that target age. If I was being uncharitable I'd say that I find the entire world that J.K created incredibly stupid and nonsensical. I don't say that much though, because there's no need to.

It is perfectly acceptable for something to not resonate with me, and there is no reason for me to denigrate that thing or anyone else's enjoyment of it. It doesn't hurt me at all for others to enjoy something I don't dig, and it doesn't serve anything positive for me to shit on others enjoyment. Sometimes something just isn't your cup of tea. In this case Harry Potter just ain't your thing.

Your criticisms are pretty basic ""I'm trying to find the reason I don't like this and am just listing off generic complaints"" fare. Everyone of them could be perfectly true, and people's enjoyment of them would be just as valid. I agree that no one should pretend like Harry Potter is on the literary level of The Brothers Karamozv, but I also believe that you shouldn't pretend that your ciritisisms are taking place in a 400 level literary crit dissertation.

t3_4g3nbn,"The first books really work in that they follow really closely the ""hero's journey"" identified by Joseph Campbell. There is a common framework to HP that you also find in Star Wars :
&gt; Campbell defined the Hero Cycle, a course of events that occurs as a rite of initiation in every myth, pinpointing the need for mentors, villains, elixirs and jesters along the way. Each step can be traced in the adventures of Star Wars hero Luke Skywalker.

Also, the writing reminds me of Roal dahl (Charlie and the chocolate factory), and or Narnia. But not as good and the language used in HP is fare more difficult to read for children.

But eventually, it's more personal, and about the characters. When reading the book I need to identify with the characters. And I can't identify with Harry. He always makes choices I wouldn't make and that I find stupid or wrong. And it goes the same for the other characters. I couldn't see myself being a friend of Harry or Hermione ever. (Ron maybe).

And that for me is the biggest drawback. Maybe HP is not literature but too often the characters feels like carton boards. Whenever the story tries to give them some humanity, it uses stereotypes.

t3_4g3nbn,"&gt;HP is a Mary Sue character

Not at all. Harry Potter is just an average hero. Sure, he has special traits that make him the main character of this story, but in everything else he's just average or below average. 

He's brave, but he's not smart. He constantly makes bad decisions that negatively affect his life and lives of people close to him. He often acts spontaneously with no regard for consequence or opinion of other people and that more often than not leads to something awful.

Ability wise, he's only average at everything but Quidditch which helps him with his depressing feelings. Most of his academic success he owes to his friends, specifically Hermione. He's decently good at battle magic, but only because that's what life was asking from him at the time and he was the only one at the school who had those terrifying experience.

He has attachment issues, anger issues, jealousy issues that are constantly shown throughout the series. He's kind of a big douche.

&gt;he does nothing

He successfully outsmarts and defeats Quirell/Voldemort in Year 1 despite being 11 years old.

He battles and defeats a giant Basilisk that nearly kills him in Year 2

He saves his godfather from hordes of most dangerous creatures in the world in Year 3

He successfully completes all Tri-wizard challenges in Year 3, despite being younger than other contestants.

etc etc. He does heroic things all the time, whatever it takes. Sometimes because it was his fault and sometimes because evil forces just want to kill him very badly.

t3_4g3nbn,"Harry Potter will kind of always be overrated to a certain group of people. People seem to have already argued the characters and writing, but I just want to put it in context. 

The first Harry Potter movie came out right as I was finishing 5th grade. It's a Young Adult genre story. Kid with a crappy life finds out he is actually part of this story that both happened and is currently happening. Especially if you watch the first two movies, they aren't spectacular stories, but man do they capture the imagination of kids. I still remember the first time Harry went to Hogwarts both in the books I read, and the movies I watched. I remember when I was sick for a week my mom would read the books to me until I feel asleep. 

Harry Potter is to my generation as say the 80's was to an older generation. If you weren't a part of it, you would say ""what the hell are they wearing, and what were you thinking?"" But they will say it was the greatest decade of their life. Right or wrong, you can't really rate someones life experience, and I wouldn't expect someone like my dad to understand why Harry Potter was so important to my generation. So the quality really isn't that important honestly, it's about nostalgia and representing a generations childhood. I am in no way a fanatic now that I am older, but whenever anyone brings it up, I think back to when I was a kid. 

If you go into a Young Adult genre movie/book and expect serious literature, you are probably in for a bad time. ",d2efish,CMV: Harry Potter is overrated,319,1,311,2022-04-29T15:08:01.110153Z,2022-04-29T15:08:01.110183Z,74.376,Historical

Harry to me is very average. He escapes a horrible home and comes into magical wonderland where he can literally do magic... and he's kind of lazy at it. He certainly doesn't impress anybody with his magic prowess, other than being very good with a broom. He can be petty, arrogant and bad tempered, disobeys orders and nearly gets people killed. In some parts of the book he's downright unpleasant. He can also be nice, grateful and loyal. Basically he's quite normal and not all that interesting. He's got a dark backstory but himself is a fairly average kind of person.

A Mary Sue (or Gary Stu, whatever) version of Harry would be something like this: he'd have a traumatic childhood with the Dursleys, until his entrance into Hogwarts. There he'd instantly become the center of attention, grasp every subject, have a harem of his own, and shortly into his time there would humiliate Snape in front of the entire school. Hermione would become a background character mostly just in awe of his intellect, and so on, and so on.

obviously. 

Terrorism is defined to be the use of force to advance political goals. 

The murderer of Jo Cox is a terrorist. 

So not all ""mass shootings"" are necessarily acts of terror. 

School shootings or schootings done by mentally ill who dont want to push a politcal agenda (or at least have not proclaimed that) like the mass schooter of newtown.

Was he a terrorist? Clearly not? was he mentally ill and disturbed? yes of course. 

Not every instance of people killing a numerous amount of people can be linked to terror, when , in fact, every case is one too many.

Examples of terrorist mass shooters:

-Dylan Roof (shot up a black church because of his racist ideology)

-Omar Mateen (shot up a gay nightclub because of his ideology)

-Anders Behring Breivik (shot up a camp because of his ideology)

Examples of mass shooters that shouldn't be considered terrorists since their motivation was not from their ideology:

-The Columbine shooters (shot up their school because they wanted attention + wanted revenge on classmates)

-The movie theater shooter (shot up a theater because he wanted attention)

-Sandy Hook shooter (shot up a school because of his mental illness + wanting attention)

-Dallas Tower shooter (shot from a tower because of a brain tumor)

If they are *white* and are committing violence because of their ideology, they are terrorists. If they are not, they shouldn't be considered terrorists.

&gt;Where do we draw the line between ""disturbed mental patient"" and ""terrorist""?

The line is exactly where it always has been - if they are using fear to push an agenda, they are a terrorist.

&gt;Roof later confessed that he committed the shooting in hopes of igniting a race war.

That means he's technically a terrorist, too, since he is trying to push an anti-black agenda.

However, I feel that as of late the usage of the word 'terrorist' has grown to imply association with a terrorist group. If the Charleston shooter were a member of the KKK, and the KKK regularly committed acts of terror (they don't actually do that nowadays AFAIK, but it's the closest thing I can come up with), then the media would call him a terrorist too.

Calling what the Pulse shooter did 'Islamic terrorism' is as accurate as calling the Charleston shooter 'racist terrorism'. The only reason the Charleston shooter isn't labeled a terrorist is because there is no racist anti-black terrorist group with an agenda that he could have claimed to have been pushing.

Basically, you're seeing racism where there isn't any.

Ultimately, the money/wealth to afford to do provide all these handouts was generated by the free market. Social democratic programs that redistribute wealth are necessarily a drain on productivity (but arguably a necessary sacrifice to ensure people with inadequate skills or disabilities are not left to suffer). Just remember what generates wealth and what doesn't when you are trying to improve wealth distribution.

I'm also concerned with the cost. A system like this would be unsustainable in the long run. It would just add more money to the national debt and the government doesn't have a good record of allocating money efficiently compared to a business because wasted money isn't as much of a concern to a government.

The problem with assigning rights like that is, who provides them? If I say you have the right to freedom of speech, or your liberty, that does not require the government to give you anything at the expense of another.

But shelter, food, water, medical care, those are products and services that require constant action and effort from others to produce / provide. 

If I say you have a right to them, does that mean you can force those professionals to provide you with their products and services for no charge? 

The other way to do it, as is normally done in welfare systems, is through collective taxation. But that's still money being spent on you from people who were unwilling to give it to you to begin with.

Like it or not, those things are important to some people. Sure, it has a 1.1GHz processor that's on par with a 2007-era Core2Duo but Apple doesn't sell processing power when it sells a 12"" Macbook. Portability and aesthetics may not be what you want to buy when shopping for a laptop, but it is for other people.

If you were able to get the same for less from a different company, then it would in my opinion be fair to call it overpriced, but I'm pretty sure you can't.

I'm a Unix systems administrator by profession, and have been for twenty years or so. I use a Mac as my main workstation, both at work and at home.

t3_71l9yj,"The price of the phones is not completely arbitrary, they are not exactly free to make.  They have expensive components, have to be put together by semi-skilled laborers, and require extensive research and development.

These are some older articles explaining how much the previous phones really cost:

https://mic.com/articles/155238/how-much-it-costs-to-make-the-iphone-7

http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-laz-iphonecost-20140917-story.html

If we assume the iPhone X costs around $400 to make, and sells for $1000, that is not as huge of a margin as you might think.  Also if you compare it to something like household furniture which is often marked up 200-400%, its not that bad.

Some of these calculations of the real cost of the phone also don't include labor and other costs, and instead just add up the cost of the individual components inside the phone.

Other costs include the marketing and creating the ""brand"" you mentioned in the CMV.  Also Apple has a history of in-house R&amp;D and making its own components, the new Apple A11 is just the newest example of this.  

Finally, its also a pretty objective fact that Apple knows what it's doing.  If you look at the history, and how it was quite recently the most valuable corporation in the world. The new iPhone might launch it back up there again.

You also have to ask yourself what are the other companies doing? Oh yeah Samsung phones burst into flames sometimes.  The head of Samsung is likely going to spend sometime in jail, convicted on corruption charges, their company is constantly involved with scandals.

t3_71l9yj,"Others already made very good points. So I will only try to change or at least relativize a specific one:

&gt; People often say that Mac is better for developers than Windows, but having used Windows, OS X, and Linux, I can say with certainty that OS X is the least capable of the three. The amount of available software that can run on OS X is minimal compared to Windows. For developers, Linux is superior, with greater customization and an enormous online community for help (as opposed to having to contact Apple tech support). And the best part? Linux is FREE.

I am a developer for more than 10 years and worked with Windows, Linux and Mac. The biggest problem when changing from one OS to a new one is that you're not used to it. I never owned a Mac myself and working for the first time with it feels super annoying. But that's not really something that you can hold against an OS. 

The amount of tools isn't really a factor either as long as you have the right tools available. Do you have examples of tools that are missing on OSX? I never heard any of our developers who are using a Mac say: ""Sorry, I cannot do that, there is no tool that can do that.""

Greater customization also isn't a relevant factor for me, I am also not even sure what you mean by greater customization and how it is supposed to help me as a developer.

For the support: while I agree that there is a big community (though I cannot imagine that you won't find any help for Windows or OSX problems), most development problems are OS independent.

If apple can remove the headphone jack and add something like even a 5% increase in battery (as that jack is really pretty big as far as components go), that trade off is going to be beneficial to a large majority of their users. Why wouldn't apple make that tradeoff? Especially if a large percentage of that 25% are just gonna grumble and buy it anyways?

I’ve said this before elsewhere but it’s not really apple’s fault that people are careless and lose their things. You could kinda argue Apple’s intentions in that regard. Maybe they show malice here because they realize that people are careless and will likely have to buy a new adapter. Apple, however, has stated on several occasions that their goal is wireless. On an anecdotal note, I’ve owned an iPhone 7 since October 2016 and I still have and use my original adapter every day. I even bought a spare to use at the gym. Also, keep in mind, that most people just use the pair of earbuds they got in the box with their phone - which in the case of the iPhone 7/+ and 8/+ is a pair of lightning EarPods.

I also maintain that apple’s cables are built well. Generally speaking, however, people treat the cables like shit. Again, not apple’s fault. Again, maybe Apple knows that people treat cables like shit so they make a cable that works but needs to be replaced when it’s treated poorly. I buy Apple cables because I don’t treat mine like shit and I’d rather buy something that definitely isn’t gonna fry my battery - I’m cautious even with MFi certified products.

People don't understand how many hard problems Apple has solved in computer vision with its AR software because most see it as nothing more than a small feature in a list, but AR is more than a feature, it's the platform for the future and incredibly difficult to pull off given the current state of technology.

The phones themselves, on a hardware level, may be valued at $2-300 but when you account for everything else that went into it... I think $1000 or so is reasonable.

It's really a catch 22, we want them to try new things but then we get mad when they do ""A prime example is the iPhone 7 and its missing 3.5mm headphone jack"", while i agree it does not seem very practical at least they are trying new things out. A lot of what we consider essential was though of as weird at first.

2. OS

They really like quality, at the end of the day most programs on MAC have little to no issues when compared to the PC environment. This results in much less inventory but higher quality, in order to develop for OS you must do extensive testing and make sure things dont break, while on the PC world it's a lot quicker and easier to push your product out (faulty or not). While this has advantages/disadvantages, Apple decided it wanted to control the quality of its products, hence the higher requirements to develop both hardware and software for apple.

3. Own equipment

Back to quality, while there are 20+ brands you can buy for PC, there are limited options for MAC but this has always been the case.

And part of that is because Apple maintains full control over their hardware and software. Not all android phones work as well as one another.

t3_5jfqhp,"A soldier perpetuates war. So in a world without soldiers there would be no war?

What would make you think this?

On a different but similar level: Police.

The police force enforce an aspect of the will of the government, which stands behind the laws we've made. Police make communities safer from obvious crime with their presence or by taking action against criminals. So that is their purpose. To enforce and protect the law.

The army has a similar but different function. Armies defend nations, and also carry out the will of their government, defending the resources the country relies on or securing border lines, passage routes, everything that enables stable development.

MY POINT: Without an army, the government will still need to TAKE ACTION to ensure the citizens/communities are safe and provided for. If there was no army, this would fall on to the police forces in the communities, because people/companies/governments still want stuff. Essentially, you would still need an army to function as a country, or form alliances with someone who has one. Trade is the ONLY other way we can overcome this, by increasing access to resources for everyone and reducing the effectiveness of an army over time. The army was necessary to ensure the resources were secure initially but trade can overcome it.

Can the blame really be put on a soldier for this? The need is created by the system we have in place. The need will be there until it's no longer needed. Unless you're willing to argue that it is in the best interest for poor people to want to die or suffer rather than join the army?

Apply this to international relations and you see the same thing. Countries are only as strong as what they can defend against.

I read your opening post, but could not find any argument that are relevant to the CMV prompt. Reading your responses to others, it seems to me that your argument against the deterrent argument is that the opposing force would also have no army. That's doesn't make sense. 

The reality is that other nations have military forces. Not having a military force puts your country at risk of being exploited. Regardless of your choices, or the choices of people in your nation, it will not change the fact that peoples from other nations have militaries and will continue to maintain them. Historically, wars of unification are sought with a justification to end all wars by putting everyone under one banner. That is a situation where one power exerts overwhelming power to enforce peace. You hope for another way. The premise of that way must be one where your nation can still get the results of having a deterrent force without actually having one, while allowing the rights of other nation states to maintain forces of their own.

If you can solve that,  and you'll deserve the nobel peace prize. Without that, soldiers serving their nation are not perpetuating war. On the contrary, they are perpetuating peace.

War can still be fought without soldiers, ships, planes or guns. 

Everyone needs food, water, shelter and other resources to live their lives. When you run out of natural resources in your home, you natural go outside of your home to obtain natural resources. The same thing happens when your country runs out of natural resources. 

But all of that can be prevented with trade right? Yes it can, however many wars have started when country's don't recognize other countries  money. Money is just printed from nothing, so it's easy to dismiss the value of a foreign countries. You can have politicians decide to not trade with foreign countries for any excuse imaginable. Anything from a prince stealing a king's wife to accusing another country of owning weapons of mass destruction. 

So militaries are necessary to invade foreign countries for natural resources and also to defend from the invasion of foreign people from stealing your countries natural resources. 

So it's better to have a military that can serve it's citizens to take and to defend. Bottom line, it's necessary to have the ability to control money and natural resources.

t3_5jfqhp,"Seeing the time stamps on a lot of these, I'm probably too late. But here goes!

Your view is one of many in a greater debate about the fundamental nature of mankind: If civilization were removed - with its national pride and drive for resources taken with it - would mankind be peaceful, or violent? 

Unfortunately, the question itself is moot; whether or not mankind as a whole were peaceful is irrelevant because there only needs to be violent individuals, few and far between, to trigger cycles of violence. These violent individuals will have to be met with violence in order to insure the survival of the whole. One this has happened, it is no longer just these individuals who must be considered violent; it is the home. TL;DR: Humans are violent.

So, if country A does not have a military, only police, and country B *does* have a military, country B *will* exploit the situation. History shows this happens time and time again. Until a global order is established, countries will compete for resources. This competition sometimes delves into violence, because that is a fundamental aspect of our species. Hopefully, we will eventually evolve out of it. In the meantime, we have not, and war is guaranteed to exist somewhere in the world.  

Following this model, volunteering to serve doesn't make you a perpetrator of war - only a participant in something that would be happening whether you were there or not. Global peace will be a consequence of a shift in philosophy and emotional maturity by the entire species over time, not the actions or inactions of a single person.

I have a couple of thoughts about your view. 

The first is that while you're not advocating for me or people like me to be killed, you are advocating that myself and people like should never have been born to begin with. Which, for future generations of people like me, kind of amounts to the same thing; non-existence. I'm wondering what gives you, or anyone else for that matter, the moral authority to say whether or not I should exist?

Your argument seems to be that we're a burden on society, without redeeming value to justify that burden. To this I would urge you to explore the many, varied, and wonderful contributions disabled people have made to society. Much like you, many of us are a part of a community of friends, family, &amp; neighbors, and participate in a mutual enriching of one another's lives. Like some abled people, some disabled people even make broader contributions to society, often by applying their own unique perspective. 

Perhaps you're thinking that I fall above your threshold for ""severe,"" in which case: who gets to decide where that threshold is, and how? At what point do someone's contributions become irrelevant, and do you think science will be able to accurately predict which disabled people have the potential to be good friend/family/neighbors/members of society and which will fall below this hypothetical threshold?

Moreover there are an innumerable number of other factors that contribute to intellectual disability, which even today cannot be predicted to any degree before birth.

The US experimented with eugenics in mental hospitals before WWII. We sterilized schizophrenic patients in an attempt to curb the overwhelming numbers of new schizophrenia cases. Germany of course dabbled with racial (and medical) eugenics during the war. The question of consent was a non starter in both cases; schizophrenics technically could not give consent to be sterilized because of their mental capacity (and because of being under the influence of heavy medication), and of course no one in Germany gave consent to anything, but sterilizations (and deaths in Germany's case) were carried out regardless ""for the good of the people"". **neither scenario played out well in the end

t3_6rwcio,"Are you talking about people carrying the gene who know for a fact that they will be having mentally retarded children? And that they should restrain from reproducing?  Because most of the time people only find out during the pregnancy that something is wrong(after the tests) so aborting the child just because it has down syndrome isn't fair... That's even more ""morally wrong"" Give them a chance.",dl8e1do,CMV Knowingly Having (Mentally) Retarded Children is Morally Wrong,6,1,7,2022-04-28T16:27:48.483797Z,2022-04-28T16:27:48.483826Z,22.482,Morality
t3_6rwcio,"This world does not run on ""efficiency"" alone. You could even argue that applying value or utility to any human life is immoral. Assuming too that science should run our lives and having the best possible human specimens is subjective. Some may argue that compassion and love have done more for the human kind than what you've mentioned. 

The largest problem here is that there's is an assumption on the value of a person's life. Ones a certain amount of money mean more than an individual. What about those who choose not to work, but depend on tax money? What about prisoners who cost tax payers 30,000 a year to imprison? Should we all haul them into a ditch and bury it? That would be truly immoral.

t3_6rwcio,"While I agree with you to a large extent, there is a spectrum to retardation.   Certainly there are children born who except for the fact they look like a human, they are so severely mentally retarded, their life is nothing like ours.   Then you have people like the kids on Born This Way who are fully functioning people.   Both would have shown Down's Syndrome.",dl8keud,CMV Knowingly Having (Mentally) Retarded Children is Morally Wrong,3,1,5,2022-04-28T16:26:44.406364Z,2022-04-28T16:26:44.406396Z,78.253,Other
t3_6rwcio,"If you consider intellegence on a scale (as per the IQ scale), is there a cutoff number below which an unborn baby should not have been allowed to live?

If you consider intellegence as a prerequisite ""right to life"", do you have less of a right to life than someone with a higher IQ (For example Stephen Hawking)

I do not think I can change your view, but I do think your view is very binary",dl8w5aw,CMV Knowingly Having (Mentally) Retarded Children is Morally Wrong,2,1,4,2022-04-28T16:25:20.436572Z,2022-04-28T16:25:20.436627Z,23.098,Fairness and equality
t3_6rwcio,"To extend your argument further, there are many diseases that drain are taxes. Many diseases that children will be born with or have shortly after birth. Diabetes 1, heart defects, etc. are you also saying that because these too will drain the system and may cause these ones to not be very productive citizens we may perhaps choose to abort them. Where does it stop. Who chooses who is acceptable to live. Who chooses who is worth the cost. Put yourself on the scale and you were born with an illness. Would you want someone to access your cost on society. Calculate whether or not you may be productive in those circumstances, and decide if you were an acceptable risk? It could get to the point that the government would not want to pay or allow anybody on Medicare to have a baby with any congenital birth defects or foreseeable medical problems. 

Is that the type of world we live in? The closest we have to that is China. There restrictions on babies. It has caused harm. But that is nothing close to what you are suggesting. But you know that.
