There's a reason that the living world - plants, animals, bacteria, etc. as a whole is referred to as an ecoSYSTEM.  All of the different parts work together to keep it functioning and we humans often forget we're a part of that system and when it breaks down, we'll break down too.

t3_701fav,"Other than the simple survival of the species, there are several other good reasons for protecting nature.

Protecting nature gives us variety. When the environment changes rapidly, many species will undoubtedly die out, and it will take millions of years for new species to diverge.  As species die out due to rapid environmental change, the species who survive/thrive are the ones which are geared to adapt quickly. These tend to be the small animals such as insects and rodents.  

Most people enjoy seeing a variety of plants and animals. It's aesthetically pleasing. 

Beyond aesthetics, [nature is often the inspiration of our technology](https://cosmosmagazine.com/technology/10-technologies-inspired-nature). We find a chemical or adaptation which gives the organism an advantage in nature, and then we figure a way to copy that same advantage for humans. The less natural variety, the less this is possible. With each species extinct, we risk losing the cure for cancer forever.

Without variety in nature, the world would be less aesthetically pleasing and technological progress would be slowed.

There are also health considerations. We may survive as a species when the air is not breathable, but we will have health problems. Also, there are health problems we may not see coming, such as when we used to include lead in gasoline, and as a result, we were slowly killing all life on earth (including ourselves) via lead poisoning.

Survival of the species isn't the only consideration. We also want to enjoy surviving.",dmzo0cs,CMV: I believe that the preservation of Earths nature isn't particularly important.

For all we've learned, we still have no idea how life began. We don't know whether it was inevitable, given the right conditions, or an incredibly improbable and lucky event. 

We know the universe is full of planets. But so far we haven't found life anywhere else. As far as we know it takes a universe full of planets bouncing molecules against each other before one special combination kicks off everything else.

If life were common, we'd expect to see some evidence of alien civilizations. So far, we don't. But if only one planet has life, then that's necessarily the planet we live on. We could be the only planet in the universe with life, and everything would look exactly like it does right now.

t3_701fav,"There has been a really prevalent idea that has become associated with environmentalism which is a misrepresentation. This idea is centered around the concept that the purpose of preserving nature is a benevolent one, *i.e.*, we should be preserving nature because it's beautiful, or it's God's creation, or that life is *inherently* important, and humanity should be protecting all life, or some other kind of non-sense. 

Really, environmentalism is about keeping the Earth from changing too drastically. Earth is an amazing place to live with all of environmental conditions necessary to support life as we know it. If we make massive changes to the Earth's environment, then humanity will suffer greatly because of it. The idea of colonizing Mars or another planet is *insanely* ambitious. If we try to colonize another planet before we can even effectively manage life and the climate of this one, we are going to be in for a really bad time. 

So I would posit that environmentalism is already about the longevity of the human race, there are just people who are part of that movement who don't fully understand that and instead try to make it about saving polar bears. If there are no people around to give a shit about polar bears, then nothing matters anyway.

For example, in some places, people felt that since snakebites were a menace, they should kill all the snakes. The end result became that fields became overrun with mice, and harmed crops.

In other places such as Guam, humans introduced snakes into the environment. Now Guam has a snake infestation problem. Since the snakes are killing off the birds, it also has an insect infestation problem.

Finally, as you said, we should harness resources. But the diversity of plants and animals provides us with many of these resources. A lot of the traditional medicine in India is under threat since the herbs needed for it are being replaced by mechanized faming.

My POV is that it's not fair and it's very selfish to think this way. Planet Earth is probably all we have, since we haven't discovered a suitable successor and terraforming, at least for now, is out of the question. 

In my opinion, nature is amazing. It's a beautiful thing, and it's much, much more beautiful than most of the things we can do. Animals and other life forms outnumber us by a lot (iirc the total weight of all ants equals the total weight of all humans), but they're unfortunately much less powerful than we are. I see it as our responsibility to care for nature and our Earth, since right now, we are the single largest threat to nature, but we also have the power to not be this. I think that if we fail to preserve our planet, we've failed as a species. Imagine having to tell your descendants that we destroyed such a beautiful thing. If we can't save Earth, it would show how untrustworthy, and how selfish we are as a society. Which is almost as sad as seeing Earth die.

Surviving and thriving are two very different things. Odds are, the human race could go on, survive, for a while without having to rely on ""nature"". Manufacture oxygen and food, that sort of thing.

Probably not you or I. 

We simply do not have the resources or manpower to thrive without the environment. We can't afford to match the oxygen output of vegetation. We don't have the time or energy to replicate an atmosphere capable of sustaining 7 billion (Jesus) people. We don't have the technology to manufacture soil for food or energy for all the toys we want. We can't supply man made coffee for the world, we need the trees and shit. 

Compelling humans to empathize with the critters with which we share earth is a foolish endeavor, because we are all selfish beings. I help people because it makes me happy. If it didn't, I wouldn't, plain and simple. Deep down, I want environment to be protected for purely selfish reasons. I love all the random shit we have. Watching football is one of my favorite things in the world. But the reality is, I get to have olive oil sprayers and xbox and baseball because the setting/world/environment I was born into allows for them as a result of extreme surplus and mankinds resourcefulness.

If you ask me, I'd say we should strive to maintain a population large enough for us to continue to go ""onward and upwards"" which is going to require millions if not billions of people. 

Now, when you consider the vast quantity of resources needed just to get our asses to Mars or wherever, you've probably invested so much that you could have easily made massive improvements to our existing planet.

But even then, say we go ahead and colonize space. Realize how dangerous it is out there. A few failures and you have an extinct colony. Thousands dead. Have you watched the series ""Mars"" on this topic? It's quite good at illustrating all the ways shit can go wrong, and there are many.

So I wouldn't put all my eggs in the colonization basket just because that basket is much more likely to break. Our basket (earth) has just a tiny hole that can be repaired compared to the assfuck that is space colonization. One is WAY easier.

This is basically the same phenomenon that leads mono-culture farms to be highly susceptible to plague. With many different strains of crop, some small portion may be lost to disease on a regular basis and the bulk of the crop will still survive. With a mono-culture, any moderately successful disease has the potential to drive extinction. The most famous example of this is the probably the Gros Michel variety of banana, which went from the most commonly exported banana to all but extinct in less than a decade.

The loss of complexity in the biosphere (typically measured under the term ""biodiversity"") is extremely detrimental to the long-term health of the biosphere, on which we are reliant.

Animals and plants are really important for us because they often hold the secrets to medicines, treatments, and other things like food flavourings and such.

He's in the same personality tradition as those who troll, but it's different.  He's not trolling anonymously where someone can only get away with it because they're behind the wall of the internet.

Trump is an asshole in broad daylight, and it's because he can get away with it.  This isn't something that's special to his Presidential run.

Banning gay marriage is discriminatory where polygamy is not. Our current governmental structure in respect to marriage is set up to accommodate 2 people where as it is not set up for more than 2. So denying marriage status to 2 of the same sex is discriminatory.

Two is the minimal required complexity. Any number more than 2 is an arbitrary limit. Two is not arbitrary, as that's the number required for conception, regardless of whether the couple intends to, or is capable of conceiving. 

Furthermore, relationships of more than two individuals become exponentially more complex for government officials to vet for instances of fraud. Don't forget that marriage is one of the paths to citizenship, not to mention tax breaks.

There are lots of society-level arguments against polygamy that don't apologise to gay marriage.

Edit: just to clarify that this is fact not speculation. Polygamist societies, both historical and contemporary, are riddled with social problems caused by the massive overabundance of desperate young men. They often solve them by being increasingly militaristic; effectively sending the young men off to fuck each other (usually rape) and die in battle, ensuring a much smaller population of older men (who are also rich with war spoils) who can then match 2:1 or 3:1 with the larger population of women. Of course, the constant warfare (besides being shit for everyone) is unsustainable and these societies either: settle in to a dynamic of mutual raiding with their polygamist neighbors (especially true for tribal pasturalist societies), collapse or become monogamists.

Making marriage a legal institution just adds an unnecessary level of paperwork for the people to file. This paperwork not only costs the taxpayer time money to keep and file it. Not only that, it creates hefty legal battles that take up time in the courts. The only thing left is seeing your loved ones when they are in the hospital etc... If you eliminate legal documents attached to marriage, all people who have a sick or injured loved one, would be able to see them.

Now marriage as a social thing, if people wanna say husband and wife, have a party, go ahead. But the legal documentation is both worthless and detrimental.

So... now that marriage is out of the picture legally, why should gays exclusively be allowed access to marry. Because businesses are people too, and marriage is a useful financial tool for coupling assets. So denying business the right to do this, will give them financial losses that they could then sue the government for, then gaining some tax exception. So marriage as a business arrangement would have to be legal. That said, the two parties cannot be allowed to be bound by children. It creates another problem upon a company splitting, and cannot be a factor at play, both parties cannot be bound by children in this financial situation.

Married people are a primary production method for more people, both with production of offspring and the transition from useless baby to functional adult. Generally this is better accomplished with two people rather than individuals. 

However there are other aspects to marriage's benefits: Married couples take care of eachother in old age, and generally establish some level of psychological wellbeing with eachother. This manifests with people being healthier and longer lived when their spouse is also alive. Another aspect of monogamy is that sexually transmitted diseases are not as easily spread because the sexual contact networks are less developed when most people are monogamous.

All of these benefits are called into question with polygamy: Sexual networks are more developed, allowing STDs to spread through a polygamist society more readily. The presence of multiple adults within the same unit skews power dynamics and may create disenfranchised parties within marriage units.

According to the Catholic Church, all Catholics must get married in The Church.  We have a procedure for getting married, there are steps to follow, and they usually are, no problem.  So long as a Catholic gets married within The Church, there are no problems.  
  
Outside of The Church, people receive natural marriages.  To receive a natural marriage is not a sin, since the people receiving a natural marriage are not beholden to Catholic doctrine.

Regarding sexuality, Natural Law states that human bodies are ordered to fit together a certain way, and that the natural result of that will eventually lead to new life.

It is important to understand why gay relationships are sinful. Catholics (the original christian religion) values unity and being selfless. Being selfless is keeping nothing for oneself. Regarding to love and specially sex, being selfless strongly relates to fertility and nature: The objective is reproduction and any artificial attempts to prevent it are sinful: This include contraceptives, abortion, and homosexuality.

Cointraceptives are sinful because they prevent nature taking place. There's one exception to this, and they are the ""natural methods"", of which you can ask about in r/catholicism.

Abortion is a sin because it kills a human being (two when it goes wrong).

Homosexuality is a sin for the same reason contraceptives are: They have no other reason to exist than pleasure itself, and so can't be selfless.

Since marriage is the only way to get non-sinful sex, and it is supposed to lead to a natural family, the only marriage allowed is between a man and a woman. People who don't know about catholicism and fertility might argue that this excludes infertile people, but it is not so simple: Infertility is a wide range of fertility issues: You will rarely find a couple who has either 100% or 0% fertility. Also, it's an anomaly, and they might still conceive with a little help. Gay couples are always at 0% fertility, and this isn't an anomaly, but the rule.

That couple then goes to a secular establishment that does serve them. The secular establishment is going to outperform the Christian counterpart due to its doors being open to a larger portion of the population, and maybe even putting the Christian establishment out of business. However, when the government steps in and says that the business HAS to serve this customer that has other options available to them, I think that it infringes on the rights of the business owner.

On essence, by catering you are becoming a part of the wedding. You are giving your blessing and in many religions, food is very important and could even represent the flesh of your savior (yuck)  so for them, a cake is much more than just fat and sugar. It is the very blessing of the baker. It is being complicit in the act. And they believe the act itself is a sin. Thereby forcing them to commit a sin by being complicit in the act

Some states have passed their own laws protecting LGTBQ status, but states are still free to do the reverse. 

However, the current set of laws being passed has a slightly different context then being discussed. This involves businesses being compelled to facilitate the actual gay marriages themselves.

Also, you were saying in another comment that then a server at a restaurant shouldn't serve a few teens because they may think they'll have premarital sex... Two distinctions, the server probably doesn't own the business, and providing food doesn't directly contribute to premarital sex like, say, selling a condom does.  Providing food directly contributes to feeding them, and what they do afterwards is largely unrelated to service at a restaurant. 

For a Christian, it can be compared to owning a gun shop and selling a gun to someone who just told them they're about to kill someone. They believe someday they'll have to stand before God who will ask why they did that for them when they knew what it was for and when they believed it was wrong, like the gun shop owner would stand in front of the police/judge who would ask them the same question. Important to note is they believe a sin is a sin and all sins are equal in the sight of God (many Christians struggle putting that belief to action though, something I'm sure you've noticed).

Informed conservatives know that this gives children the best chance to start life either in the middle class or in the lower class on a trajectory into the middle class. The Brookings Institute has plenty of evidence for this on their website.  Marriage really is a key issue in fighting poverty. Progressives tend to devolve marriage into a human invention malleable to the will of the masses without really considering what effects will come 2-3 generations down the road. Kids suffer from that.

Nazism was ""new"" and progressed away from previously held values in Germany of the 30s. Bishop von Galen and Dietrech Bonhoffer held up conservative values in that milleu and most of us are thankful they did so, even though the latter died in a concentration camp due to his views and the Nazis planned to kill the former after they won the war (thankfully they failed).

You're describing social conservatives as only slowing down positive change to a pace that the general public can tolerate.  But social conservatives also try to keep negative change from happening because social progressives take it too far.  

For example, it is good to fight against white people being racist against black people.  But it is not a good solution to institutionalize racism going the other way, like in the case of affirmative action.

It is good to fight against discrimination against LBGT people.  But it is not a good solution to take away someone's freedom to decide who they do business with, like in the case of requiring a baker to bake a cake for a gay wedding.  (In fact, it runs counter to American values like freedom and liberty for all).

It is good to have all sides presented when faced with controversial issues of public importance.

I’m not saying that there shouldn’t be a minimum wage, just that a minimum wage at $15 likely is too high. A recent [study from the University of Washington](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/02/seattles-minimum-wage-hike-may-have-cut-wages-and-jobs-study-author.html) found that low wage workers lost an average of $125 a month when the minimum wage was increased from $11 to $13 dollars an hour (although an earlier raise from $10 to $11 actually increased their earnings). Employers reacted by cutting hours and jobs, so the average low income worker was worse off. Now any policy that hurts the poor, I'd argue is counter productive and wrong. 

It's hard to apply this to the national level and there have been other studies that found contradictory results, but there is substantial evidence that conservative’s opposition to a $15 minimum wage may be better off for the working poor.

Hypothetical family has every right to just go door to door and offer to do something like mowing the lawn for the neighborhood and make way more than minimum wage.

What is meant by *natural*? The person with this *opinion* may be using the word to mean something very unscientific.

Sounds more like a challenge than a claim about whether or not it's physically *possible*. Maybe the speaker simply means to say that they find it so highly improbable that anyone would manage to successfully lose weight in a healthy manner via this method that it may as well be considered impossible.

The problem is that people don't always say exactly what they mean in a way that makes sense to the person with whom they are communicating.

Do you have to have exclusively homosexual sex? What counts as sex?) and then try to find it in nature. If I find two penguins in a zoo that seem to be gay, I can then report it. You'll need to decide if you agree with my definition of homosexuality, if you believe I correctly observed the sexual behavior of the animal, and if you believe I didn't somehow contaminate the experiment (for example, maybe bring in a zoo is what makes the penguins homosexual). All of those add up to some probability of homosexuality occurring in nature.

1-) Definitions can not be proven scientifically, as they are not empirical entities.

Thus, in their opinion, being gay is not natural.

First, while homosexual behavior is seen in animal kingdom, it is not decided whether there are animals that form exclusively same-sex partnerships. Many animals that show homosexual behavior also mate with opposite-sex and produce offsprings. Further, if the definition of homosexuality for animals is the same as for humans (i.e. attraction to same sex only), it is not possible to know if there are truly homosexual animals, as we can't measure attraction in animals, only mating-related behavior.

It's not clear whether the same thing happens in wild sheep, and if LeVay's explanation is right it probably doesn't.

People think 'gluten free' is healthy - most of them don't have celiac. People think 'fat free' plastered on the front something means it's healthy because 'fats are bad'. Candy is fat free, and **newsflash** fats are *essential* to a healthy diet, and certain fats are very healthy.

There are vegetarians and vegans in the world. That speaks for itself.

t3_4clvbk,"It's certainly a form of neglect, but I don't see that it fits the legal concept of abuse. The parent is failing to meet a reasonable standard for their child's nutrition (neglect) but they aren't starving them or forcefeeding them (abuse.)

The other part of this is that if this were criminalised, the state would have to take action against parents with obese children. It'd be lovely to think that a visit from a dietician and a social worker would do the trick, but given that habits are very hard to break, in many cases the family wouldn't substantially alter their behaviour. At this point, what happens? In traditional child neglect/abuse scenarios, if a home visit and maybe some sort of support (in this case maybe vouchers for healthy food or free vegetable delivery or something), if the situation doesn't improve, the state would be compelled to remove the child from the home and place them in foster care. 

This in and of itself is traumatising to the child (and is associated with a dramatically increased risk of future drug abuse, teen/unwed pregnancy, mental health problems, etc) and they'd have to remain in care until the parent - what? - learns to cook healthy meals? They might, most probably would do anything to get their kids back, but isn't this starting to seem like an excessive intrusion of the state into private life?

A parent can't force a child to be active or exercise, especially if that child has a physical ailment or disability like asthma, etc. Many parents don't have the ability to constantly monitor a child's food intake or activity level, as they're away from the home a lot of the time (working long hours, for example). Plus any kid with a decent level of autonomy and an allowance can walk/bike to the local store and buy as much junk food as they like.

A child might have a decent diet, but if the combination of their physiology and activity level causes their weight to rocket out of control, how much blame can you put on the parents. Schools are cutting phys ed classes and recess, communities are bucking against youth sports leagues that put emphasis on performance (which entails conditioning), parents are more fearful of letting kids outside to play, especially as crime/violence escalates in some communities.

I think this is the key piece that we should focus on. What would your goal be? Would you like to allow other people to copy and sell the work for money after 20 years instead of 170?

From society's point of view, what would be the difference today? Someone will do the selling. With an endless amount of competition from other content creators, they wouldn't be able to, and it also wouldn't be in their interest to charge a prohibitive amount. Whoever is doing the selling will still need to charge something. Whether it's paper, or CD's, or bandwidth, or hosting a website, or lastly, time, there will be some non zero cost.

There was a time when you might be forced to buy bundled things that you didn't want. $20 dollars for a VHS movie meant you were forced to buy packaging (A significant cost), and an insurance premium in case the retailer couldn't move inventory (retailer margin, even larger than packaging). But today, there is very little argument left for this. You can watch a movie over the internet for close to nothing, bypassing any unwanted packaging and physical media, and there's no risk premium that you need to pay for the seller's inventory risks.

I'm not really sure you want to see changed. Even if you could legally copy a movie, you'd still have to go and buy media to store it on, and/or internet to transfer it, or be forced to watch ads.

The renewal period allows for the quick passage of most works into the public domain, while allowing for commercially viable works to remain so for many years to come. The 50 year maximum is long enough that even for most works that are still commercially viable, the creator would have likely retired or died, so a longer copyright duration is unlikely to encourage more creation (which is supposed to be the entire point of copyright).

The renewal system is a direct response to the problem of abandoned works under copyright, which are no longer used by the owner, but can also not be used by anyone else, often because the owner cannot be found.

Assuming the first work is of high enough merit to support the creator for life, I disagree that we should encourage creators to churn out new art solely to make money.

An artist who struck gold once is not necessarily going to strike gold again and again. Say, To Kill a Mockingbird and Go Set a Watchman if we accept Go Set a Watchman as a sequel (although it of course has some dubious publication history that make this unlikely). It's unfair to the creator to force them to publish constantly, rather than let them publish when and if creativity and novel ideas strike them.

Artists who are interested in being creative have had no problem continuing to publish despite wealth - take J.K. Rowling or numerous musical artists. And, if a piece of art can support its creator for life, it has certainly been adopted into popular culture.

t3_4sntrj,"&gt;The premise is this: If you create something, it becomes part of the culture in which you live.

This really isn't the premise. The premise of copyright (and patents, etc.) is this: Having people create things is good for society, even if we give them exclusive rights to sell those things, and people would create much less if they didn't have those exclusive rights.

So we give them exclusive rights, because we want them to create, even if that means that they are the only ones that can profit from them.

Even with copyright, people are free to allow something to become part of culture immediately if they want to. Evidence suggests that that is not what motivates people to create... otherwise they would do that. People create largely because they can make a living (and potentially a reasonable retirement) off of their creations.

Society is benefited *no matter* who profits from the creation, simply by the fact of creation. Even an *infinite* copyright term would be a good bet for society if, indeed, it got people to create significantly more.

The *vast* majority of stuff is forgotten even in 15-20 years. 

It's those *exceptional* things that last for decades that we even institute copyright for in the first place. Those are exactly the things that we want to incentivize people to create. But why would anyone bother to go to that much trouble when they can create 10 things that are remembered for a few years with the same effort?

Society benefits considerably less from derivative works. And it benefits not at all from other people being allowed to profit off of an existing creation.

B) The original copyright holder is entitled to seek out royalties. This should work similar to the current rules for recording cover songs. Currently, you do not need permission to sell a recording of your performance of a copyrighted song but you are expect to pay royalties based on your sales (i.e. if you don't successfully sell a single copy, you owe nothing, if your cover ends up selling millions, the song writer is legally entitled to a pretty nice check). Applying this for derivative works means that you don't have authors being screwed because Hollywood waited 15 years to make the film spin off and you don't see a single cent or even a line in the credits for the story that you wrote.

t3_57ahdb,"Thomas ligotti has a reddit account? What a time to be alive.

Negative Utilitarianism is as easy to disprove as a sound theoretical action framework as utilitarianism. Basically, the theory of maximizing happiness is no different than one that prioritizes minimizing pain in terms of how to view contingent violence 

(A caveat for those unaware, Thomas ligotti, wrote a book in 2012 that tldr said ""conciousness bad, but suicide is dumb cause it causes pain to those you love and increases net suffering, only way to solve would be an extinction of humanity."") 

This also requires us to make the determination that human violence is a result of consciousness. There is a firm split in the growing death literature between Robert Lanza and Thomas Ligotti on this issue. A myriad of other authors, including Mark Heisman and John(?) Mark would argue that consciousness is not the cause of violence but human bodies as conceptualize them now. This is why sexism, racism, all the -isms that are the root cause of violence materialize. 

Lanzas argument is that there is either an afterlife, or there is coming technology, namely transhumanism, that rids us of pain, suffering and the condition of humanity, while still maintaining consciousness. So basically, we live with the pain now until we become beep-boop robots or we can also hold out for the afterlife.

Let's step away from the sense in which your statement is necessarily true and turn towards a sense of human preferences we'll call Utility. How do you know suffering is bad, because people extend resources and effort to avoid it. Preferences, summarized as Utility, inform at least some of your world view.

So from your post I would guess a simplified version of your argument would be that a person in non-existence would have no needs unfulfilled, and a person in a Utopia would have no needs or more than a person in non existence unfulfilled, therefore the Utility of not existing must be better than the Utility of living in a Utopia.

t3_57ahdb,"Suffering is all relative - we may feel we are suffering greatly, and then with the experiences of someone who has overcome that suffering may look back at it as a positive experience, or look at a relative level of suffering which changes as things in one's life get better/worse.

I've 'suffered' boredom countless times memorizing new information or mastering a skill through repetition of something mindless, which left me needful of stimulation or excitation at the time only to grant me satisfaction(another need) later. 

So I guess my argument is twofold; firstly, a utopia would not actually relieve suffering of all kinds, since *relative* suffering is ultimately irreducible as it relies on a concept of 'normal' which is fluid; secondly, the potential satisfaction of suffering averted/overcome would disappear from humanity after genocide but not after utopia.

I might also point out that that there is a tremendous amount of trepidation, anxiety, heartbreak and despair that accompanies extinction which manifestly does *not* accompany utopia, and I feel your argument is thusly indefensible when you say that utopia would cause the same amount of suffering.

t3_57ahdb,"tl;dr 

Extinction does not reduce human suffering at least as well as achieving an utopia would, it removes the humans who suffer.  

------------------------------- 

Satisfying needs quantifies an overall feeling of accomplishment (some basic needs like food which are necessary, some needs like internet which are not necessary to survive).  By ""quantifies"" I mean that, by your definitions, happiness is proportional to satisfied needs. 

For extinction to reduce suffering, it means that this quantified feeling is somehow improved, compared to now. For extinction to reduce suffering at least as well as a utopia, means that I can compare this overall feeling of accomplishment in satisfying my needs. 

But extinction does not reduce suffering, it removes suffering by removing needs. You can say that removing needs is equal to satisfying them (I have the need to eat, I built a system that keeps me alive without eating, the need of eating is satisfied) but without me being aware of that what you have achieved is not reducing suffering but removing the object which suffers.

In other words, suffering of a conscious being exists only if the conscious being exists as well. There is no suffering to be improved without something that suffers being aware of it. You remove the need to boil the water before making coffee by removing coffee.

Essentially heaven and hell is better than purgatory as long as there is more pleasure in heaven than suffering in hell.

t3_57ahdb,"&gt; the positive qualities exist for the end of preventing suffering

I object to this part. There is more to happiness/satisfaction/contentness/whatever than just not suffering. You can be varying degrees of happy.

A world where a few people suffer and many are super-happy is better than a world where nobody suffers and nobody is happy. We can argue about different types of doing the calculation, like whether it's total happiness or average happiness that matters, but in both cases a world with no people will be either mediocre (average utility zero) or terrible (total utility zero).

Most people don't kill themselves, so we can be confident that most people think their lives have more happiness than suffering. Extinguishing them will reduce more happiness than it would reduce suffering, driving both total and average value *down*.

EDIT: One objection you have that is related to that is

&gt; So-called higher pleasures - art, music, intellectual pursuits - are all subservient to these needs, as they either function to A: distract us from unmet needs in ourselves or others or B: exist to facilitate the goal of meeting these needs. 

If this were true then there is no super-happy people, only people who are as happy as dead people (i.e. not suffering).

t3_57tl4k,"So, when talking about economics, or foreign policy, you start with a set of core beliefs that define your worldview, and then build upon them to form opinions about other things.  The arguments that lead to a policy decision stem from core beliefs, and understanding which core beliefs you agree with allows you to understand which policies you should side with.

For example, in US politics, a particular assumption that is frequently made is whether it is better to have a large central government, or a small central government.  Neither side can *prove* their position correct, and both sides will build upon this central concept to define their positions on other matters.  Which is better is likely subjective, rather than objective.  This means that you can develop an opinion on things like banking regulations by understanding the opinion of those who share your core beliefs.

The people who share core beliefs likely also have similar opinions in policy decisions.

Fundamentally this boils down to the fact that with some of these there is no ""right"" answer.  There are lots of wrong answers (ill thought out solutions, or objectively false assumptions), and for a given set of well defined constraints (core beliefs) there is likely a right answer, however the right answer depends on the constraints, which are different for different people (are subjective).",d8v17p8,"CMV: People who study complicated subjects like the economy and American foreign policy for a living are unable to agree on important policy questions, so it's pointless for me to try to develop an opinion on those policies.",1974,Public opinion,1,1095,2022-05-18T10:29:24.199600Z,2022-05-18T10:29:24.200600Z,1276.214

I infer that this is because you believe that consensus among ""experts"" is a good indication of the validity of a theory or opinion.

This is a very dangerous error to make.

These ""experts"" you look to, i.e. economists and political scientists, rarely if ever test their theories and hypotheses with randomized controlled experiments. Not because they are evil, but because these tests are typically economically and politically impossible.

Unfortunately, the iteration of generating hypotheses and testing them through rigorous experimentation is the only somewhat reliable way we know to produce knowledge of causal effects.

If an analysts makes a claim of the sort, policy A would cause effects B, C and D, that claim amounts to a causal assertion. The final authority on the truth of which is always rigorous experiment - not consensus of any social group, no matter what their job title. 

If you have spare time to inform yourself of anything, I recommend epistemology and the philosophy of science. Once you know how to reliably produce knowledge, then you can take a look at the methods used by the people you revere as experts. I think you will find in many cases that it amounts to fancy statistical speculation rather than science.

Professions are much like religions in that they are social groups bound together by ideas. You wouldn't take consensus among Mormons on their doctrine as evidence for the validity of the doctrine. Apply the same logic to the professions.

1. I once saw this quote on reddit ""You know what the problem is with being an economist? Everyone has an opinion about the economy. No body goes up to a geologist and says, 'Igneous rocks are fucking bullshit.'""
People tend to have opinions on basic economic issues that are not up for debate. For example, Trump and his supporters are against free trade, despite the fact that it has had unanimous support from economists. This is the first reason to learn about economics, understanding important concepts, graphs, and trends will help you weed through what is obviously bullshit in the national discussion.

2. Some stuff is disagreed upon by economists. However, many economists develop their stance due to implicit and confirmation biases. Supply siders are often- not by coincidence- lifelong conservatives who hold conservative values. It is important to have a knowledge of economics in order to determine what the data says rather than what people's opinions are. For example, if you learn that trickle down economics is not based in fact, you can form an opinion on what the marginal tax rate should be based on your values, rather than based on the idea that a lower marginal rate will help the poor. 

3. You talk about being right in regards to foreign policy and economics, which is only the case when something is universally or overwhelmingly beneficial to everyone. For example, you can be right about the Iraq War or Free Trade, but you can't be right about what how much we should tax the rich. Things of that nature must be decided based your economic knowledge combined with your values.

Yet when harvesting foods millions of insects, rodents, and birds are killed every year. Where is the outcry from the vegans over this travesty? Why aren't vegans avoiding all corn and wheat based foods?

Bottom line: It is hypocritical of vegans to judge others for killing animals when they themselves contribute to the killing of animals as well.

The argument can't be made that it is acceptable to kill these animals, because you've already established that drawing a line is not okay

t3_4otmqi,"The only real argument against your logic is that it isn't hypocrisy. Most people are completely aware that various animals can be kept as pets despite being good food in our culture as well. However, when people are against the killing of dogs for food, or cats, it's because people grew up having them as pets. We in our culture have formed a bond very closely. While some people might have had other various animals as a pet, such as a pig you have mentioned in another post, we grew up in a culture where eating them is not a big deal. When it comes down to it, it's not hypocrisy but rather cultural differences based on emotion. If I were to not nitpick your wording, you're otherwise correct.",d4gb7uv,"CMV: People complain about the chinese dog festival (Yulin) but not about all the other animals that we, westerners eat, that's hypocrisy.",1923,Cultural identity,1,1044,2022-05-16T16:44:07.803394Z,2022-05-16T16:44:07.803394Z,23.963
t3_4otmqi,"Dogs are of similar puzzle-solving intelligence to many farm animals, and probably lower than pigs there, but are of higher social/emotional intelligence. There are plenty of animals that we are discovering are quite high on the raw intelligence scale (crows, parrots, etc), but it is really the level of social intelligence that governs how much we empathize with these animals. Monkeys, apes, whales, dolphins, elephants, dogs. All of these are animals that are able to feel ""love"" as we understand it for members outside of their direct family group ([though dogs are limited on some higher-order emotions that we sometimes assume they have](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201303/which-emotions-do-dogs-actually-experience)).

It's because of the empathy we can feel for these animals that they fall in separate category when it comes to the people who step forward to defend them in cases like these. For dogs, especially, since they are raised as companions, we see these social behaviors firsthand as well as the range of their emotions.

So while from a ""capability to suffer"" standpoint this does not separate a dog from a chicken (unless we consider the suffering of the survivors), this should at least explain why people emotionally categorize chicken separately from dogs, and also why those categorizations are not totally invalid.

I would note that at least for pigs, studies have demonstrated a fairly sophisticated emotional intelligence, so arguments to separate them from dogs lose most ethical footing and mostly boil down to suitability as a companion. As you said, pigs can be pets, too, but they are harder to train, messier, don't bond as easily with humans, and aren't as well-suited to be working animals.",d4fgumh,"CMV: People complain about the chinese dog festival (Yulin) but not about all the other animals that we, westerners eat, that's hypocrisy.",1922,Morality,1,1043,2022-05-16T16:43:43.156697Z,2022-05-16T16:43:43.156697Z,113.775

t3_4otmqi,"&gt; There's an argument that we have them as pets, but imo that doesn't justify it  

It's a huge difference though.  Some people have spiders or mice as pets, but I am not sure you'd hesitate to wipe them out of your house, pantry or bedroom, right?  

The relationship we form with a species is very important when determining what is moral or not.

Vegan is different than a vegetarian or humanitarian.  A vegan is a dogmatic approach that proposes that humans should not make any use of any animal product, not even eggs, honey nor silk.  Vegetarianism is a diet, veganism is an identity, almost religious.  Please don't confuse the two.  

There are gradients of approaches to this issue, where skinning dogs alive for fun is one extreme, and going full violent vegan is another.  
How about recognizing that eating animals is still a part of humanity we have been unable to leave behind, but reducing quantity and slaughter suffering is a necessity?  This is a step in the right direction.  Otherwise your position is ""extremism or hypocrisy"" which is becoming popular on social media where you have to make rocket launchers legal in order to get guns, or ban baseball bats in order to control guns...ridiculous argument.

As a result, dogs are much more useful as companions, security guards, and hunting partners than they are as food. Eating dogs is bad for the same reasons that human cannibalism is bad.

I should note that my position is toward dogs and dogs only. Cats are a much more recent addition to human life and are far less useful from a security or hunting perspective, so they are not part of the equation. Horses are arguably more useful alive than dead, but they too are a much more recent addition to human life, so they don't count either.

t3_4otmqi,"The difference of opinion on eating dogs versus other domesticated animals is not one of morality, but rather it is the nature of the domestication.

The most pervasive theory on the origin of the modern dog is that humans began the relationship by taking docile pups and using them to help hunt, guard camps, and other utilitarian purposes.  Modern dogs have evolved alongside humans to perform all kinds of different tasks; we have bred them to hunt, herd, and guard for us.  We have even bred them for purely aesthetic purposes, i.e. ""cute,"" ""tall,"" ""short,"" etc.

In the west, this utilitarian view of dogs is pervasive and is akin to horses (which are also not seen as a source of food).  While other cultures do not see dogs in a similar fashion, the evolution of the modern dog was not based on being a food source, it is based off of their utilitarian traits.  This, and only this, is the distinction between eating, say, a cow or a pig (domesticated and bred for the purpose of being a food source) and eating a horse or a dog (domesticated to assist us with various tasks).

I think a good analogy would be the difference between roses and corn.  Both are domesticated plants, but the rose was domesticated because some humans decided it was pretty, while corn was domesticated because some humans figured out it was edible.

None of these are ""predator"" animals. A dog is naturally a predator animal that is descended from wolves which eat meat.

As we were once hunters and still are we have a very strong connection to other hunter species and respect them. Its because we can form hunting bonds with dogs, and cats we can live mutually exclusively. Pigs don't provide anything except meat. Cows provide milk and chickens provide eggs but can they defend your homestead against other predators or other hunters? Not really. A dog can though, A cat can go against most vermin. 

In the wild if it was me against a dog, nature doesn't give a shit and a dog would easily eat me and I would eat it. But we live in society and dogs love society and we should respect them for that. 

In short dogs are our bros. Hunters don't eat other hunters, mainly because its too dangerous but for humans today, its out of respect for how rare  some hunters are and that we are on the same side.

No other animals do this. They are tuned into our emotions. They know how to read if we are happy, angry or upset.

First of all, we are already capable of providing all of these things.

We could solve world hunger today if we really wanted to, because we grow enough food to feed everyone in the world.

&gt;because order requires following the rules and not buckling the status quo, and you couldn't maintain that order if people strongly disagreed upon things.

But we have societies where people strongly disagree upon things that still maintain order. It's not utopian order, but it is order nonetheless, despite strong disagreements.

t3_4tf91m,"White privilege encompasses a number of widely varying concepts beyond just the obvious economic ones. 

[Check out this piece by Peggy McIntosh](http://nationalseedproject.org/white-privilege-unpacking-the-invisible-knapsack). Much of what we mean when we talk about white privilege comes from this article from 1989. It lists many things that are invisible to white people and don't involve money, such as 

* I can if I wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race most of the time.
* When I am told about our national heritage or about “civilization,” I am shown that people of my color made it what it is.
* I can go into a music shop and count on finding the music of my race represented, into a supermarket and find the staple foods that fit with my cultural traditions, into a hairdresser’s shop and find someone who can cut my hair.
* I am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group.
* I can turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my race widely represented.

All of these are very real to most non-whites. Financial advantage is a separate, though often connected, issue. Privilege has as much to do with not having to worry about alienation and isolation, or the possibility of physical harm, as it does with being financially secure. 

Edit: Actually McIntosh explicitly says, ""I decided to try to work on myself at least by identifying some of the daily effects of white privilege in my life.

Everyone likes to say, history is in the past. We're here now and if blacks live in poverty now it's their fault. As if starting from someone's else's property, to being handed 40 acres and a mule (and the having that taken back and getting lynched if you looked at someone the wrong way), eventually getting the right to vote, access to education and jobs after decades of protests, riots, lynchings, assassinations, and arrests didn't somehow effect the present situation. And even though the people that supported ""separate but equal"" are still alive, nooooo any trace of racism in education, government and politics is surely nonexistent. If you really think the problem is wealth, then look at what blacks started with in this country (as part of a white man's wealth), and ask yourself how could that not impact what it's like to be black in today's society?

Sequestration from society is necessary to protect others from the harmful individual. If you break the rules, you no longer get the chance to break them again. Murderers can't murder again, thieves can't steal again. This still makes sense as a practical necessity in a universe without free will.

Rehabilitation is the next step. Ideally, while sequestered, you should be taught skills that will prevent you from performing crimes in the future.

We can still direct our population down paths that will be more socially beneficial.

In that case, it would still be good to keep punishing people for immoral behavior.

The possibility of public blame and punishment should be seen as an input factor into the brain's *mechanic* decision processes.

If the universe is completely deterministic, then everything happens for a reason. But these reasons are so complicated that we cannot comprehend them, and we abstract them in a bunch of different ways. One of those abstractions is what we understand to be free will.

In fact, while a deterministic universe is an extremely intriguing and entertaining topic to discuss, it doesn't have much practical value, even if true, because the system is far too complex for us to make any useful conclusions from it.

In this way just or unjust also lose meaning, if viewed from a deterministic standpoint.

However this doesn´t mean that our justice system is unable to account for absence of free will. For one, we due have laws that apply to the state of mind of a defendant.

Furthermore not every law or punishment is based on intent, for which you would need free will.

E.g. speeding is a strict liability violation, whether you knew or intended to speed doesn´t matter. Even if you are brainwashed, it would not matter.

t3_4x7vi8,"You don't seem to understand what is meant when there is a claim that there is no free will. 

The claim of no free will is based on the inability of humans to not pick what they want most. It is a process where the subconscious will determine the choice to make. Ergo a human wouldn't have free will, he would be dictated by his or her desires. 

The thing is that these desires take a lot into account. If you consider buying an icecream then you consider the good points, like taste and deliciousness, but also the bad points, like calories and price. (the desire to lose weight and the desire to have money for other things) And how heavy those categories weigh depends on the importance a person gives to those categories. 

So in the case of a justice system, it comes into consideration, it is like the calories and price, an negative consequence of a criminal act. Your subconscious will take it into account and therefore there is a need for punishment, because the justice system existing does diminish the amounts of crimes committed. 

Also you need to understand that the justice system has more utility than just punishing the criminal, it also protects society from criminals by locking them up. It tries to prevent the criminal from committing another crime by making the consequences clear, and it tries to stop other wannabe criminals from committing crimes by showing them that there is punishment.

t3_4x7vi8,"The best arguments against free will (B. F. Skinner Beyond Freedom and Dignity, or Yoga Philosophy, or Samkhya, or Advaita for example), do not posit predestination. The idea in general is whether there is an entity which we cannot see or prove to exist which resides outside the world of cause and effect, yet which, without cause, jumps into this world of cause and effect and changes stuff. 

On a personal level this is called freewill. On a cosmic level it is referred to as God. These two ideas are really the same idea on 2 different scales. By rejecting the idea of something interfering with this world which is beyond cause and effect from outside it, they also reject the idea of pre-destination. 

If you flip a coin it is not necessarily predestined to come up heads or tails, but it is caused and acting according to law. The coin, if conscious, could try all it wants for some result, but that wouldn't change anything. 

If your act of flipping the coin was caused and lawful, that wouldn't necessarily prevent you from not flipping it if you noticed a car racing directly toward you. This new factor would alter the probability of a coin flip.

So let's say that person A is predestined to murder person B. This murder occurs. Now society has evidence that person A does not operate the same way that they do, they are capable of taking a life if they're in a specific situation, given specific inputs. So we exclude them from society to increase the safety of others. We hope we can reform or reprogram those chemical pathways, hoping that those inputs and conditions have a different result the next time the person experiences them.

t3_4x7vi8,"The question of free will is separate from and irrelevant to the functioning of the Justice system for several reasons. 

The first being that it is a system which is the necessary corollary to any government based upon a body of Laws. The Justice system is not about Justice, it is about enforcement of Laws, regardless of whether or not they are Just.

The second is that the existence of penalties acts as a deterrent, regardless of Free Will. The goal is to minimize the violation of laws, and the existence of a formalized, relatively consistent system of enforcement and punishment does dissuade people from breaking laws, or at least from behaving in such a reckless manner that they get caught.

And the final reason is that it serves to segregate those who have broken the Law from regular citizenry in a manner that makes their Will and its violent or destructive expression irrelevant to the general populace, regardless of its Freedom.

In my opinion, the question of Free Will is actually a pretty nebulous and useless question. We are complex biological creatures. Our motivations and actions are determined by a multitude of factors beyond our conscious control. Even our consciousness is, barring a supernatural element, the experiential expression of our underlying biological self. Our Will is effected by internal and external circumstances, and much like an equation resolving down to a solution, we resolve upon a course of action.

for him, moral responsibility hinges on the generalized abilities that make a person competent or incompetent in what ever category they are being assessed. there's more to his compatiblist position than that, but really all i have to argue is that there are more categories than just the 'moral responsibility' one that are worth considering when convicting someone. others have pointed toward a consequentialist justification for locking people up based on the likelihood that they will act in such a way again (or in signaling a warning/deterrent to society). afterall, ""locking people up"" does not by necessity include in itself any moral condemnation - it could solely be for preventative purposes. 

i agree with sam harris on this point- that if there was a pill to uncontroversially transform criminals or harmful psychopaths into normal productive members of society, that we should give it to them the way we give medicine to someone whos sick, and that opting out of giving the pill and instead continuing to punish them for their misdeeds would be senseless in such a case.

This is actually an ethical issue I've also discussed before, and it's an interesting thought experiment.

Your basic premise is that we currently punish people who choose to commit a crime, which is why autonomous actions, intoxication, and other situations where choices has been removed are defenses to many crimes, and if free will doesn't exist it isn't a choice.

But we can square those concepts in two ways:

(1). The only part of philosophy about criminal law is affected by a lack of free will is the retributive part; the part actually about punishing someone for the wrongs they chose to do. The utilitarian aspect is strengthened, as the purpose of punishment for criminal action is to create a deterrence. Under a deterministic outlook, that deterrence would be the primary goal of law enforcement. We punish so that (a) this individual will be less likely to reoffend, and (b) others are more likely not to commit that crime.

(2). Determinism does not mean there is no decisionmaking. It just means that the decisionmaking is not subject to some overriding conscious choice. But if we accept that people are incredibly complex computers, our focus is on reprogramming them (Orwellian as that may sound). As above, that means trying to change their future decisionmaking, but the consequences can flow in the same way that if you released a website that isn't working, first you would take it down for a period of time to try to fix it with as little downtime as possible, then using more and more downtime until (either because the page does something really godawful, or its irreparable) you either keep the page down indefinitely or delete it.",d6d9npa,"CMV: If free will doesn't exist, the justice system is fundamentally unjust",1786,Morality,1,907,2022-05-15T16:22:45.807311Z,2022-05-15T16:22:45.807311Z,6.926

If we have *the choice* to punish someone or not, then we do have free will, and your entire premise falls apart.

This is true whether things are deterministic or not. 

A justice system adds a *cost* to the ""social behavior"" side of the matrix, making it again a rational choice to behave appropriately, because of the cost of punishment.

They are recognized by their host country as their gender (this is mostly a political requirement). 2. They must have been on a hormone replacement therapy regimen for at least 2 years. 3. They must have had sex reassignment surgery if it is available/practical. 4. They must pass a blood test which shows their testosterone levels going into the competition which may not be above a baseline level which many cis women are above.

Hormone replacement therapy has many positive benefits for male to female trans people, however none of them are athletically relevant. There are many detriments, however, which do have impacts on athletics.
1. Reduced metabolism makes building muscle and maintaining weight more difficult
2. Reduced steroids in the bloodstream result in loss of muscle mass and reduced stamina.

So the two I'm referencing is the FtM wrestling champion from Texas who won the girls division in wrestling and the MtF body builder who won the Women's weight lifting competition in Australia. So let's take this to basic human growth with puberty. The FtM transitioned early enough in their life to impact their hormones during the major growth periods in their life, meaning they have the testosterone of a boy their age and their muscles will develop the same way a biological boy would. The MtF, which I'm taking a guess here as I have not found any information saying so, went through puberty as a male, meaning they had their muscles develop on the lines of a biological male before transitioning, giving her an unfair advantage over top of her competitors. They do have rules against this, like her testosterone levels needed to be below 10 nanomoles/liter meaning she contained as much testosterone as her biological female competitors during and 12 months prior to the competition. She also competed as a male body builder prior to her reassignment, meaning she more than likely passed puberty as a biological male which would give her an unfair advantage.

So for most sports, we have a male and female category.  This is because typically (though not always) men would outperform women, and we would have no way of recognizing the athletic achievements of women.  However, given that only a finite number of people will ever get any recognition, why should a higher performing athlete not be recognized ahead of a lower performing athlete.

Moreover, if the guy who placed 4th in the men's category outperformed the women and the trans athletes, why should he not get a medal?  

We make these separate athletic categories so that people who have no business winning can feel like they have a shot at winning.  They therefore train and compete and we all get to watch.

t3_60u6bk,"Well I agree with you but I do enjoy a challenge so let's give this a shot.

.... 

The best argument I can think of lies with the brain. If you examine the structures of the human brain of a transgender female you should note that they are different from those of a standard mans. The structures in the frontal lobe, if memory serves, of a trans female basically match those of a genetic female. 

This can lead one to conclude we are looking at the wrong parts when determining gender. 

If we are looking at the wrong parts it is reasonable to  conclude that we may be in error in not labeling these people as women for athletic purposes.

Why?

The body is nothing more than a complex life support system for the brain. As the brain is the whole of our experience, the whole of who you are, it is the organ which should be looked at to determine gender not supplementary parts and structures which can be modified or removed without causing the death of the organism.

If we take the brain as the determining factor then there is no unfair advantage as  they would be classified as women because their brains are female. The brain being the determining factor renders the hormonal, and structural arguments for and against them moot.

There's a number of problems this might cause, considering that effects of hormone therapy can differ between individuals, not to mention that any change in performance for MTF athletes would be different than those experienced by FTM athletes.

The issue boils down to this; how significantly do gender-reassignment procedures/therapy alter the performance of an individual? If it doesn't bring them in line with the performance levels of their intended gender, then they are getting an unfair advantage or disadvantage as a result. Then again, if they *are* brought in line with the target gender's expected performance, does that mean that some innate excellence might have been quashed, or that they've been given more athletic capability than they'd have had if they'd been born their target gender?

The way I see it is that current gender-reassignment techniques are simply not adequate for athletes, and that unfortunately means that individuals who undergo gender-reassignment should either be placed in their own categories or simply not allowed to compete. If and when the technology advances far enough that gender-reassignment can be done at the DNA level, the issue can be revisited, but as it is there's simply too many things that can't be controlled for.

t3_60u6bk,"So Western medicine is changing in how it addresses HRT and treating of gender dysphoria. In the past most trans people went through a puberty that was consistent with the sex they were assigned at birth and as a result have irreversible traits associated with their sex assigned at birth.

Now if a child identifies as trans and their doctor agrees they can be put on hormone blockers which delays their puberty. At an age when the child is old enough to begin making life changing decisions (I think its 16 in the United States but am not entirely sure) the child can be given HRT to induce a puberty of whatever the gender they identify as.

This means that the gap between cis and trans people in regards to athletic performance will likely get smaller as time goes on and the medicine around gender dysphoria gets smaller. Any rules set up to bar trans people from competition would likely be obsolete in the near future as a generation where many trans kids have never undergone an incorrect puberty comes to age.

Why do we need to split it up by gender? There are tons of women stronger and more athletic than me, and yet I'm more qualified to play on a major sports team than them simply because I'm a man. Sure, we can argue women have Women's Teams™, but it's a fact that most people only watch men's teams.

I think discussion is a *good* thing, because kids *will* encounter religion, all around them, from a young age.

Prior to exposure to religion, I've taught my child to be a free thinker and to respect the beliefs of others. I've taught my child that a person's beliefs are their core and that it's important to remember that a person is a sum of their experiences, and their experiences will not match mine or those of anyone else. 

As my child got older, my child's peers started talking about God, heaven and hell. I've expressed to my child that she can believe whatever she would like to, as long as she is properly informed. Ultimately, I will let her make her own decisions as long as she takes the time to do the research and learn about the different systems of beliefs to find whatever makes the most sense to her.

With that being said, the concept of a god is illogical to her. The idea that there's this omnipresence that judges your every move is creepy, and to be told that murder is bad, but our soldiers who murder innocent people are saved by this Christian god doesn't make sense to her at all. 

The key to parenting, with anything that you strongly believe, is to instill the tools and confidence your child needs to make the right decision, and as far as faith is concerned, that is a deeply personal decision. If you teach your child logic and rationality, and teach them to be informed, not only will they realize exactly how illogical religion is, it gives them the tools to realize the world around them and how there's a lot that may not make sense to them, but they aren't going to go and attack people about it either.

Buddhism teaches you some basics that gives you tools to grasp not just reality and your own mind but the behavior of others. For the purposes of your post the central one being ""makyo"" or delusion:

- Every experience you have is a delusion because the brain simulates the world and presents you with a literal hallucination that you think is ""seeing"". This explains dreams, seeing things in the corner of your eye that aren't there, not seeing the blind spot, seeing UFOs etc.
- The base state of a brain is confusion. This explains why crazy religions exists when there is no basis for them. It also explains most of the evil caused by humans in the world. It also teaches you compassion towards criminals and fanatics because you understand that they are just overcome with delusion. It also explains why we don't punish children with jail time when they strike other children.

You're making the exact same mistake as religious conservative parents.  You think what you say matters.  You think the values you speak will have any influence on the values they hold as adults.

The truth is, we teach our children 99% by example, good and bad.  How many parents have you heard complaining about how ""kids just don't listen""?  Well, it's basically true.  If they *ask* you, they will listen to your answer and weigh it.  If you speak at them, they'll basically just write you off.  They may hear the words you speak, but they watch what you do more.

Children very often rebel against their parents.  How many liberal people do you know who have ultra conservative parents?  Do you think that only happens one way!?

If you want to teach your children the value of logic and reason and anti-bigotry then you must *live it*.  If you preach to them that religious people are illogical bigots, their first experience with someone who is religious and logical and not a bigot will shake their faith *in you*, because you have set a negative example.

At this point, religion serves the same purpose to me as does any other mythology or work of fiction. It's entertainment. It's a ""fandom"" if you will. There are lessons to be learned from it, and there are lessons not to be learned from it. By examining it's intricacies, we can get an interesting insight into human history and culture, and what types of things affect the human psyche. 

Sometimes I put on a worship CD and sing along with it. Partly because I enjoy the harmonies of the music, partly because I enjoy ""role playing"" along with the fiction, and definitely partly because I have nostalgic and sentimental attachments to certain aspects of my former belief system. To be clear, at no point do I think to myself ""god *actually* exists and *literally* sent his son down from heaven to die for my sins...etc""


Because I view religion in this fashion, I must offer up an explanation as to why so many people take it so seriously, as if it was the literal truth.

I feel like you should present some of the well-known bible stories (and other major religions) in the same way you would introduce the popular Greek/Roman/other myths, or Aesop's Fables. You aren't setting out to provide historical truths of divinity, but using extremely well known stories to teach lessons. For example, David and Goliath is about overcoming a seemingly insurmountable disadvantage with a creative approach (beat the huge guy from distance rather than the way he wants). You might not get a lot of life lessons out of Noah's Ark, but you can tie it into other Great Flood stories like the Epic of Gilgamesh. That leads to discussions on how such different cultures developed- or built upon- the same mythologies. 


Long story short, I think turning your back on the literature and mythology of religious texts closes off a lot of lessons about our histories and what guides certain cultures even today. You have a big opportunity to open the door to some of the oldest parables that people hold dear.

Let's say you're stuck on an island, and the only means to improve your chances of survival is to cooperate with the other unlucky fella. Is it selfish to cooperate? Does selfishness really have to exclude others' benefit?

When dealing with someone suicidal, there will always be a conflict of interest. The situation is inherently irrational and the suicidal person is demonstrably incapable of making rational decisions, for the following reasons:

Suicide is often enough motivated by the idea that ""my life isn't worth living and it won't become worth living in the future."" No matter how correct this assumption is, the only way to make the opposite happen, is to live and try to change the situation. The status quo is obviously torture enough as it is. 

Suicide ""by depression"" is a self-fulfilling prophecy. In suicide, the depressed actively contributes to the aforementioned idea becoming fact. Only by making real changes to your life - and probably getting the occasional push from someone supportive - can your life become worth living.

Suicidal tendencies and motivations, and the will to live a pleasing life, are feedback loops. But both can be said satisfy you (in more or less stupid ways), and are therefore selfish. But only one of these can truly benefit others in addition to yourself.

Suicide is selfish, like most other decisions in life.

t3_72cx8c,"The biggest issue with suicide because of depression being selfish is that what's selfish is completely subjective. Let's say I'm living with roommates in college and one of them asks me to do the dishes, but I don't want to. Is it selfish of me to want to spend my time doing the dishes? Or is it selfish of my roommate to think his time is more important than doing the dishes and that I should be the one to do them? Most people would say that I'm selfish in that situation, but what if I was working a full time job and the roommate didn't have a job, would it change anything?

As another example let's say there are two 7 year-olds and one is given a chocolate bar and he wants to eat the whole thing by himself. Is it selfish if that child eats the whole thing?

And that's ignoring that depression is an ilness that is highly treatable, and you can recover quite nicely from, which makes suicide a rather short-sighted solution too.

The trauma of finding a corpse hanging from the ceiling, or your son dead in bed from some poison, or having someone crash into your car, or whatever other hell you leave in your wake for someone to find could very well leave permanent and severe scarring.

So in short, suicide causes more pain than it solves, and has lasting negative effects for others, while it solves a temporary pain. ",dnhspke,CMV: Committing suicide because of depression isn't selfish,1634,Quality of Life,1,755,2022-05-14T06:53:32.533988Z,2022-05-14T06:53:32.533988Z,21.943

If you've chosen to have children, then you have opted out of your ability to off yourself for the duration of the kid's childhood. Deciding that *your* needs are more imperative at that point is selfish, because a parent's suicide would be enormously damaging to a child in every respect.

If there are elderly people or disabled people in your life that you are the primary caregiver for, then nope, you don't get a pass. If you arrange for some other option for their care, then you are good to go I guess.

That being said suicide in a way is both selfish and unselfish. I've always viewed it not as a means to an end of suffering or depression but a transfer of those things. While the person committing suicide is at peace they only solved the problem for themselves and passed it along to everyone else that is close to them. I think the misconception and why people view suicide as strictly selfish is the amount of thought and effort that goes into ending a life. If someone is becomes very emotional its more likely that they will act with their feeling rather than thinking of the consequences of their actions. So while the person committing suicide feels as though they are within reason it may be the influence of emotion that highlight the bad experiences that leads them to suicide.

Yes, depression can make a person think quite irrationally, but that doesn't justify the way you choose to act on those thoughts- the action of suicide is still selfish. It spares you of your pain (one person) over the pain of many, it is saying you are more important than anybody else and your pain should be prioritized. 

No, I am NOT saying your pain isn't important. But other people are in pain, too- it is all about finding a treatment that works for you. I firmly believe that if you feel hopeless because nothing is working, it's not because nothing can save you, it's just that you haven't found it yet. Keep looking. Everyone is different and responds to medications, therapy etc. differently, so you can't honestly say there's ""no hope"" it just means you haven't put forth enough effort. That's like saying you can't find a job and it's been several years- one must wonder, have you really been applying everywhere? Have you gone in, asked questions?

t3_72cx8c,"certainly, it is known that depression is a disease that affects the neurochemical mappings of our brain. i have witnessed it, a radical shift and change in mood, behavior, and emotion.

certainly, if sufficiently depressed, a person cannot fathom another option but the one that in their mind makes the most sense. for someone to offer them otherwise could be like trying to fit a square into a round hole. 

However, given that they are not in a healthy state of mind, what I think really matters (that I think essentially precludes the discussion of selfishness) is being able to rehabilitate that person's mind. They may choose to think that suicide is the option but it is because of their mental state that they make that decision when in an otherwise sober state of mind they would not have entertained that thought.

**Selfish** - *devoted to or caring only for oneself; concerned primarily with one's own interests, benefits, welfare, etc., regardless of others.*

Suicide -whatever the reason- fits that bill almost down to a T. If you have to bend the meaning of a word to make that word not apply to an action, then that action is accurately described by that word.

The mistake people often make (and I suspect you are making, too) is that they want to defend suicide and in doing so, have to iron out the fact that suicide is, in fact, inherently selfish. They then run into the cognitive dissonance of ""Suicide = good, selfishness = bad, suicide = selfish, therefore suicide is both good and bad"". 

Instead of trying to bend over backwards to make the word ""selfish"" not apply to ""suicide"", people should instead accept that fact that suicide is indeed selfish, *but not necessarily wrong in spite of that*.

Some choices are selfish, and some are benevolent. It's almost impossible for us to know because how much someone has considered before taking an action is in their mind which is not completely rational even in the most healthy of us.

I don't think it should even be a question of selfishness. Some people just don't feel they have the power left to carry on, and it's a matter of whether they can be supported and find an internal source of the will to live or whether they'd don't get that when its needed. Some who would criticise another contemplating suicide would not then support that person to find meaning in their life.

Some who commit suicide genuinely believe that it's for the best, their ability to think and empathise outside of themselves may be hindered by depression or they genuinely might have such tenuous links in life that it seems an easy option.

I'd just like to thank you for having the ability to rationally analyze something and using that ability.

As someone who frequents TRP, it is *not* about hating women. What happens is that people get frustrated with reality. The realization that life isn't fair, that some men are doomed, that we've been lied to all our lives when mommy would say we needed to be nice gentlemen and treat girls like queens and they'd love us, all of that deception and misleading information leads to frustration and anger.

I've since reached out to several people on their sub via PM and helped some of them privately since I'm not allowed to publicly.

We need to raise our sons to be emotionally open people, and not to think that ""boys don't cry"". This is only one example.

I think where I branched away from TRP and MRA was in the solution. Just because men face problems doesn't invalidate the ones that women face. Most feminists (a common target) are more interested in pushing for lifting up women than bringing down men (with some and notable exceptions). I don't think feminism will fix those problems, so men need their own movement to remove their stereotype and work on discrimination and false perceptions. But it shouldn't be one that is antagonistic towards feminism or women.

A lot of the sexism I see from TRP I think comes from a place of hurt.  When you face these types of problems and nobody even acknowledges them, it's natural to hurt and lash out. I imagine many groups have felt the same way over history. Much of the sexism from feminists comes from a similar place. We need to learn to work together, not draw more artificial divides between us.

If there's one good criticism of feminists, it's that: the creation of this divide between feminists and non feminists.",d1f8n8a,CMV: I think the Red Pill is mostly correct about women and society.,1573,Other,1,694,2022-05-13T16:00:44.048624Z,2022-05-13T16:00:44.048624Z,31.285

t3_4c4ypf,"Just want to say that I see TRP as a place for discussing cold hard truths, and offering solutions. As men we're often raised to see things a certain way (ie. ""blue pill"") that's totally wrong, and often taboo to even talk about. 

Don't pit this as an ""us vs. them"" victim mentality. That's a pissing match that's never going to resolve anything. Men are discriminated against and women are discriminated against in various different forms. It's just that women vocalize their grievances through feminism while up until now men haven't really had a socially acceptable outlet to do so.

I think you could've brought up stronger, more concrete issues in this post. For example:

* Double standard regarding alcohol and sex (there was a case at a university where a drunk boy and a drunk girl had sex, and only the man was expelled from school)

* Affirmative consent laws - basically making men liable of rape in every sexual encounter. Some feminists are trying to classify a man saying ""hi"" to a woman on the street as sexual harassment (see that viral Youtube video of 10 hours of walking in NYC as a woman)

* Men being guilty until proven innocent by the public in rape accusations. False rape accusers aren't punished, and the mere questioning of the legitimacy of the accusation makes you a ""victim blamer"". All this despite the endless barrage of high-profile cases like Columbia Mattress girl, UVA ""gang rape"", Duke ""gang rape"", Palentir CEO's psycho ex-girlfriend, and Eric Frimpong that've ruined innocent men's lives. 

* Men getting raped in divorce court

t3_4c4ypf,"Yes, in our society, men suffer from sexism in a plethora of ways. However, TRP does **not** offer a viable solution. Take their views on sexual strategy, for example: It is indeed a problem that men suffer from the current social dynamic of sexual strategy. However, the solution TRP offers is to instead try and make women suffer from sexual strategy. This method of 'fixing' sexism which trades the victimization of one sex for the victimization of the other is extended to many other problems perceived by RP. I agree with you that the way media portrays sexism does not reflect the actually way sexism manifests itself in everyday life. However, TRP does not fix this portrayal.

t3_4c4ypf,"&gt; We always assume men to be the aggressor in any encounter. Women actually commit more domestic violence than men, yet we always assume it's the man who is abusive. Another example, ""My husband tells me what I should wear"" Sounds bad right? How about ""My wife tells me what I should wear."" The first sounds worse because we assume that a man with some power in the relationship will abuse his power, but we don't assume the same for women.

I don't think this holds. Generally when I hear men say their wife dresses them, it's in the context of ""I can't be bothered to understand fashion, so I just defer to my wife's fashion sense."" That's very different than a woman who actually has opinions on what she wants to wear, but is disallowed by a controlling husband.

The thing with TRP or any ideologically charged community is that there is enough thing a happening around the world that, if you dig enough you can almost always find examples that either support or refute the ideology. TRP, for the most part engages with this; they sit around and share stories about women being abusive, women being petty, stacked courts, etc and use these stories as ""proof"" that we live in a society that is hostile to men. The inconsistencies of these accounts and counter-evidence is surpressed with a conspirational view of feminism and women; for example in TRP, most rape accusations or abuse accusations are ""really"" just women gaming the system, and if they are successful it's because of a matriarchal conspiracy keeping men down, etc etc

In the TRP environment, you will never encounter evidence, stories or ideas that run against the overall narrative (that society is stacked against men) and as a result, the more you will come to see the TRP perspective as the only perspective, because most of your information will be coming from a TRP background. 

My challenge to you in simple: for every hour spent on TRP, also try to spend an hour on mainstream news media and another hour on SJW-Tumblr.

I soon realized that 'social class' is well and alive in America, and it's comprised of both the perceived status/prestige of a job and the take-home pay. I didn't realize this until I found out that working to revolutionize a transit system meant I wore a hi-visibility jacket and drove a truck- if I tried to talk to a woman, she'd look at me like I was scum.

All of the points you bring up above, inasmuch as they are true and can be backed up with reliable studies, are consistent with the mainstream model of gender.  This is the nature of scientific consensus: it tends to be consistent with available evidence.

To contrast, the red pill ideology is totally non-scientific.  It does not represent the consensus of any scientific community.

""Taking the red pill"" is intellectually no different from believing in a flat earth or any other such unscientific idea.

The first sounds worse because we assume that a man with some power in the relationship will abuse his power, but we don't assume the same for women.

I mean, who is this ""we""? No ""we"" don't always think that at all. Also, the gender of the perpetrator shouldn't matter. But the fact that the *victims* gender is skewed should tell you something about the society we live in.

When I do this, the energy otherwise taken up by my fear-based, self-interested ego -- this energy becomes re-channeled.  From here, compassion and empathy emerge as the first sensory experience.

I started on a meditation path because I liked the ideas it talked about.  And yet I cannot explain why I experience a sense of deep caring in the practice.  I see through my thoughts, feelings, and behavior, and underneath, this deep caring is always there.  Even when we are acting violently, this deep caring underlies the experience, but unfortunately it is not fully realized and therefore not always channeled appropriately.

I also believe that this is more of an expression of who we are when we are not giving into that part of our brain that endlessly fixates on threat avoidance.

So I have become an optimist because I have experienced and choose to continue experiencing the deep caring underlying all my experience.

t3_55vimx,"The Confucian philosopher Mengzi (Mencius) believed that human nature was essentially good. In support of this belief, he came up with this hypothetical: 

&gt; The reason why I say that all humans have hearts that are not unfeeling toward others is this. Suppose someone suddenly saw a child about to fall into a well: anyone in such a situation would have a feeling of alarm and compassion—not because one sought to get in good with the child's parents, not because one wanted fame among one's neighbors and friends, and not because one would dislike the sound of the child's cries. From this we can see that if one is without the feeling of compassion, one is not human. (Mengzi 2A6; Van Norden 2008, 46)

What he's saying is that, *when everything else is removed*, humans would rather do good than do bad. The examples you cite above are of people doing bad things because it is profitable for them - they get something out of it, whether it's money, power, sexual gratification, or something else. You're not comparing good vs. evil, you're comparing unprofitable good vs. profitable evil. And because humans naturally do have a selfish side (we wouldn't have survived this long if we didn't), the profitable vs. unprofitable debate will sometimes take precedence over the good vs. evil debate. That's why the Mengzi argument is so persuasive for me - when you remove all the baggage and reduce the problem to simply ""would I rather do right or wrong?"", it becomes pretty clear that most people would rather do right.

Nurturing is clearly a part of our nature anyway, since it's a necessity for human survival. So trying to neatly divide the two is very difficult because it starts so early and humans will die in the absence of it. We aren't an animal you can release into the wild from birth and just see how it turns out.

So let's run through some scenarios:

Adult with child. Adult is in much more control over the situation than the child, therefore it's wrong.

Teenager with younger child. The teenager is in more control over the situation than the child, therefore it's wrong.

Two younger children. Depends on the situation, but again, the power dynamic is what's important. If it's two children innocently experimenting, we typically don't judge it as wrong to the level of criminal. It is simply something that can be handled by talking to the children involved.

Two consenting adults. Both adults in relatively equal control over the situation, therefore, it's okay.

Drunk adult with sober adult. The sober adult is in much greater control over the situation than the drunk adult. Therefore it's wrong.

Two drunk adults. The control is close to equal. Therefore it's okay.

In particular, there's the case of a person who is so drunk that no reasonable person would consider them capable of understanding what they were consenting to.

t3_4xcsiu,"You cannot fully consent to anything without fully understanding and appreciating the weight of a decision. Let me propose a similar situation to that of a highly intoxicated person consenting:
A 13-14 year old girl willingly has sex with a 30 year old man. Did she give consent? I suppose, but was she raped? absolutely! That is textbook statutory rape. Why though? 
It's because society as deemed the decisions of minors to engage in sexual acts as not legally binding. We do not consider the brains of minors to be capable of making a fully informed rational decision and therefore the decision to engage in intercourse is judged to be entirely that of the 30 year old man, in the eyes of the law the man agreed to sex, the girl couldn't, hence the man is considered to have raped her. 

Now let me draw comparisons between this case and that of an intoxicated woman who is of age. 
While intoxicated you are incapable of making fully informed, educated, rational decisions. Therefore by the same logic that makes statutory rape illegal we must also draw the conclusion that anyone who is mentally impaired cannot consent to sex with another person and that only the man in our scenario consented to sex, ergo: rape. 

You made the case of you being responsible for your actions in the scenario where you assault or murder someone while intoxicated, this is irrelevant because those are acts of aggression which one would argue are never rational be it sober or not.

This is a nightmare in the legal system and a reason why is even if you can prove two people had sex, you can't prove whether or not it was consensual. She said yes or he said no: these statements are weighted equally in the court of law.

That's why the consent rule with regards to alcohol is so important because it gives an, albeit imperfect, ""rule of thumb"" for litigators. If one party was so drunk, then it's easier to determine whether or not it was rape based on establishing how drink that party was.

Further, since your stance is built around personal responsibility, why is there not the same standard held to the one not claiming rape?

You say this system we have is flawed, which it is, but it is our system. If you're drunk and knowingly have sex with a drunk person, *you* are also responsible for making that decision, even if you believe there is consent, you must proceed knowing that you're in a dubious position. What if also, the person was drugged but not by you and you still have sex. if she claims rape, even by your definition she would be right because she *was* drugged.

The fact that the violater actually pointed a gun towards your head, therefore making a threat, is clearly immoral, but your action was consensual.

To allow certain rules to have loopholes in certain situations would create an incredibly slippery slope.

As with your example this again is someone putting themselves in a situation and making a bad decision, however this should not serve as a bar to conviction.

Each is an enclosed room of its own, with a door facing the open air. There is a solid brick wall between each single room facility and each contains a toilet, a wash basin, a sanitary bin and often a baby-changing station.

That said, the unisex-for-all has several advantages I would like to suggest:

- Will break down cultural stigma over a generation or two (no immediate help, granted, but maybe future generations could benefit the same as we look back on past anachronisms).
- Will equalize treatment of the sexes (excepting urinals) where regardless of gender (birth or identity), the same queue exists for all.
- Will allow positive bystander effects as well as negative ones (e.g. you will increase the likelihood of encountering people who won't stand for other people being bullied). As new facilities will be larger and servicing twice the traffic, they will be more likely to have witnesses and discourage praying on somebody alone.

If perceived threat is the issue then you're going to have to run background checks on every person that enters the bathroom, and not let anyone with a criminal history of violence

&gt;Solution: make all bathrooms unisex.

I don't want to pee next to heterosexual men (and the more I live as a reasonably attractive girl the less comfortable I am with that idea) and I believe there is at least some advantage to segregating facilities based on perceived sex. I've spent too much time arguing that allowing trans women into women's facilities is a safety issue for trans women to abandon that belief entirely.

As a cis woman, I have felt discomfort using unisex bathrooms. But when I think about it, the only basis for my discomfort was 'it's unusual'. The bathrooms are all stalls, so there's no risk of being exposed to unwanted genitalia. I am no more isolated or in danger than I would be passing through a corridor or in some barely-used stock cupboard, and we don't segregate those by gender.

Sometimes bathrooms are places where you go to sort out clothes or make up. I can go in a stall if I need to change and there's no reason to be uncomfortable with a guy seeing me touch up my foundation.

There is no real negative effect on me for being in the same bathroom as a guy, which means I need to get over my discomfort.

The gender neutral toilets where I worked were basically a hallway where there were doors to the individual toilets that could be locked, and inside there was a toilet, a sink, a mirror and a hand drier for you to use. They were essentially individual rooms for people.

If we have safety problems and harassment in this neutral washing hand places like you say, then we would have to put a mirror and a handwasher in every individual restroom, but I don't think this would be necessary, and honestly I don't think people care who they wash their hands next to.

 1) Don't legally bar anyone from any bathroom. Yes that technically makes them unisex which you seem to mind, but I am not stopping there 


 2) Do require a minimum standard of privacy in bathroom stalls. Seriously. Half-inch gaps (or bigger!) in the stall doors are disturbingly common, as are woefully inadequate partitions. Unisex bathrooms are unappealing primarily for this reason. You should not be able to look above, below, or around the privacy barrier of a toilet. Period. 


3) Continue to provide bathrooms with urinals as well as without. Mark them as such: instead of men's and women's, use a toilet and sink icon, or toilet + urinal + sink.

3) Artificial Superhuman Intelligence (ASI), smarter than a human in all fields - this is where it gets interesting in relation to your point. 

Because we could never code an AGI totally by ourselves from the ground up (theres wayyyy too much going on) the most promising way to reach AGI is to build a series of ANI's connected by neural networks that can research AI, edit it's own code, and learn from its mistakes/successes. We would have a program that can make itself smarter. The smarter it got, the better it would get at making itself smarter - the growth would be exponential. As a result, not long after it would hit AGI, it would have an 'intelligence explosion' - the curve on the graph of intelligence vs time would start to get really close to being vertical (infinite intelligence).

t3_4dat5a,"This is going to be fairly simplistic, but useful. Imagine human knowledge as a circle.

Previously, humans learned very general things. You can imagine the total knowledge as a circle with a small radii representing depth and the interior of an arc as the breadth of the individuals knowledge. The breadth of knowledge was necessary as food shortages forced any one member into a variety of roles. As advancements in food came about, individuals were able to specialize and gain more knowledge in any one field while sacrificing knowledge in other fields. This can be represented as the circle of human knowledge expanding while the individual's slice becoming smaller. As humans become more and more specialized due to a larger and larger food surplus driving population growth, a given individual will be able to continually expand human knowledge, while knowing a lesser breadth.

So while human knowledge expansion may slow down, the limiting factor is not the knowledge itself but food surplus. It the rate of human growth slows down, then knowledge expansion will slow down but not until then.

t3_4dat5a,"This is a relatively simple point, but I think it is also worth noting that specialization has a role to play in combating the knowledge overload problem. 

Medicine is perhaps the most obvious example of information overload; it's impossible for a single physician to treat every possible disease state or even know how to go about proper diagnosis and initial management; rather they know when they don't know the answer and refer to colleagues with different specializations. We've gone from ""Doctors vs. Surgeons"" to separating out even individual fields into subspecialties (like interventional radiologist vs. diagnostic radiologist vs. interventional neuroradiologist).

I think medicine disciplines are somewhat unique because that knowledge needs to be active knowledge; you can't rely on the internet for near-instantaneous access, you need to know it, confidently, in the moment, so it's a better way of assessing whether individual humans are getting knowledge overload.

So the solution is not longer and longer training times (although we are seeing that to some degree), but rather more branch points within training, and becoming more specialized. This is obviously enhanced by the fact that the professors themselves are becoming more specialized.

I'm not in academics, but I think that a similar process is likely occurring there; you aren't a chemist any more, you are a quantum chemist or a thermodynamic modeling chemist or a macromolecular organic chemist.

Remember that education is a field that is also being actively researched as of late. Having been through the public education system I would argue that the majority of student time is spent performing useless tasks that ultimately did not contribute to their understanding of some crucial subject matter. Already, the rise of the internet has made a huge difference in dropping the learning curve for some serious subject matter. This has made it possible for teenagers to make it to Silicon Valley, and ingenuity to come from unlikely places. There is still a huge room for advancement in the fields of education, and who knows what kinds of advances will improve this system?

Currently, the process of becoming an expert in a field who is able to contribute meaningful research to its development requires about 20-25 years of education.

A restructuring of K-12 curriculum to eliminate waste and introduce important emerging fields could be one of the first steps towards this end. Better methods to absorb and retain information could exponentially decrease the amount of time spent learning, and thus completely negate or even reverse the effects you mentioned.

If you own a means of amplifying speech by distributing it widely, nobody has a right to tell you how to use it. Well, they can *tell* you, you just don't have to listen.

Now, the First Amendment prohibits the US Government (well, specifically Congress) from making laws that abridge these rights, so technically the First Amendment doesn't apply here. But technically the First Amendment doesn't apply to the speech being discussed here either, since it's not the government intervening. If we're talking more generally about freedom, both freedoms are equally worthy of protection.

Companies just have to do what they think will make them the most money within the confines of the law. Giving groups a platform on which to organize and perpetuate hate isn't going to make companies money (letting Nazis hang on your site is bad for business), so companies don't let them do it.

&gt;It is their right to speak their minds. 

No, it's their right to not go to jail for speaking their minds. It's not their right to force anyone to host their hate speech. 

""Free speech"" is one of the most misunderstood rights we have in this nation. You're not allowed to always say whatever you want to say through any platform at any time.

t3_4g3nbn,"Harry Potter is perfectly accurately rated in as much as those who like the books like them, those who do not like them do not, and those that are indifferent remain indifferent.

I'm one of the third group. I've read the series in it's entirety. I wasn't particularly impressed, but was mildly entertained. More than anything I found the books were far better at triggering my memories of having read much better books when I was at that target age. If I was being uncharitable I'd say that I find the entire world that J.K created incredibly stupid and nonsensical. I don't say that much though, because there's no need to.

It is perfectly acceptable for something to not resonate with me, and there is no reason for me to denigrate that thing or anyone else's enjoyment of it. It doesn't hurt me at all for others to enjoy something I don't dig, and it doesn't serve anything positive for me to shit on others enjoyment. Sometimes something just isn't your cup of tea. In this case Harry Potter just ain't your thing.

Your criticisms are pretty basic ""I'm trying to find the reason I don't like this and am just listing off generic complaints"" fare. Everyone of them could be perfectly true, and people's enjoyment of them would be just as valid. I agree that no one should pretend like Harry Potter is on the literary level of The Brothers Karamozv, but I also believe that you shouldn't pretend that your ciritisisms are taking place in a 400 level literary crit dissertation.

t3_4g3nbn,"The first books really work in that they follow really closely the ""hero's journey"" identified by Joseph Campbell. There is a common framework to HP that you also find in Star Wars :
&gt; Campbell defined the Hero Cycle, a course of events that occurs as a rite of initiation in every myth, pinpointing the need for mentors, villains, elixirs and jesters along the way. Each step can be traced in the adventures of Star Wars hero Luke Skywalker.

Also, the writing reminds me of Roal dahl (Charlie and the chocolate factory), and or Narnia. But not as good and the language used in HP is fare more difficult to read for children.

But eventually, it's more personal, and about the characters. When reading the book I need to identify with the characters. And I can't identify with Harry. He always makes choices I wouldn't make and that I find stupid or wrong. And it goes the same for the other characters. I couldn't see myself being a friend of Harry or Hermione ever. (Ron maybe).

And that for me is the biggest drawback. Maybe HP is not literature but too often the characters feels like carton boards. Whenever the story tries to give them some humanity, it uses stereotypes.

t3_4g3nbn,"&gt;HP is a Mary Sue character

Not at all. Harry Potter is just an average hero. Sure, he has special traits that make him the main character of this story, but in everything else he's just average or below average. 

He's brave, but he's not smart. He constantly makes bad decisions that negatively affect his life and lives of people close to him. He often acts spontaneously with no regard for consequence or opinion of other people and that more often than not leads to something awful.

Ability wise, he's only average at everything but Quidditch which helps him with his depressing feelings. Most of his academic success he owes to his friends, specifically Hermione. He's decently good at battle magic, but only because that's what life was asking from him at the time and he was the only one at the school who had those terrifying experience.

He has attachment issues, anger issues, jealousy issues that are constantly shown throughout the series. He's kind of a big douche.

&gt;he does nothing

He successfully outsmarts and defeats Quirell/Voldemort in Year 1 despite being 11 years old.

He battles and defeats a giant Basilisk that nearly kills him in Year 2

He saves his godfather from hordes of most dangerous creatures in the world in Year 3

He successfully completes all Tri-wizard challenges in Year 3, despite being younger than other contestants.

etc etc. He does heroic things all the time, whatever it takes. Sometimes because it was his fault and sometimes because evil forces just want to kill him very badly.

Really, the only Deus ex Machinae I can think of in the series are:

- Fawkes showing up in the Chamber of Secrets

t3_4g3nbn,"Harry Potter will kind of always be overrated to a certain group of people. People seem to have already argued the characters and writing, but I just want to put it in context. 

The first Harry Potter movie came out right as I was finishing 5th grade. It's a Young Adult genre story. Kid with a crappy life finds out he is actually part of this story that both happened and is currently happening. Especially if you watch the first two movies, they aren't spectacular stories, but man do they capture the imagination of kids. I still remember the first time Harry went to Hogwarts both in the books I read, and the movies I watched. I remember when I was sick for a week my mom would read the books to me until I feel asleep. 

Harry Potter is to my generation as say the 80's was to an older generation. If you weren't a part of it, you would say ""what the hell are they wearing, and what were you thinking?"" But they will say it was the greatest decade of their life. Right or wrong, you can't really rate someones life experience, and I wouldn't expect someone like my dad to understand why Harry Potter was so important to my generation. So the quality really isn't that important honestly, it's about nostalgia and representing a generations childhood. I am in no way a fanatic now that I am older, but whenever anyone brings it up, I think back to when I was a kid. 

If you go into a Young Adult genre movie/book and expect serious literature, you are probably in for a bad time. ",d2efish,CMV: Harry Potter is overrated,319,Other,1,354,2022-05-05T12:14:18.740172Z,2022-05-05T12:14:18.740172Z,13.147

Harry to me is very average. He escapes a horrible home and comes into magical wonderland where he can literally do magic... and he's kind of lazy at it. He certainly doesn't impress anybody with his magic prowess, other than being very good with a broom. He can be petty, arrogant and bad tempered, disobeys orders and nearly gets people killed.

He's got a dark backstory but himself is a fairly average kind of person.

A Mary Sue (or Gary Stu, whatever) version of Harry would be something like this: he'd have a traumatic childhood with the Dursleys, until his entrance into Hogwarts. There he'd instantly become the center of attention, grasp every subject, have a harem of his own, and shortly into his time there would humiliate Snape in front of the entire school. Hermione would become a background character mostly just in awe of his intellect, and so on, and so on.

obviously. 

Terrorism is defined to be the use of force to advance political goals. 

The murderer of Jo Cox is a terrorist. 

So not all ""mass shootings"" are necessarily acts of terror. 

School shootings or schootings done by mentally ill who dont want to push a politcal agenda (or at least have not proclaimed that) like the mass schooter of newtown.

Was he a terrorist? Clearly not? was he mentally ill and disturbed? yes of course. 

Not every instance of people killing a numerous amount of people can be linked to terror, when , in fact, every case is one too many.

Also I dont see your point that we have to acknowledge future shooters as terrorists. We do not know their motives. Which might be political. Which might not be political. 

We ought to treat every case seperately and not use a broad brush to treat them all, this is how you create apathy for the real problems and fear of the illusion.

Examples of terrorist mass shooters:

-Dylan Roof (shot up a black church because of his racist ideology)

-Omar Mateen (shot up a gay nightclub because of his ideology)

-Anders Behring Breivik (shot up a camp because of his ideology)

Examples of mass shooters that shouldn't be considered terrorists since their motivation was not from their ideology:

-The movie theater shooter (shot up a theater because he wanted attention)

-Sandy Hook shooter (shot up a school because of his mental illness + wanting attention)

-Dallas Tower shooter (shot from a tower because of a brain tumor)

t3_4pbwvb,"I agree with you that the brexit shooter was a terrorist, because they had a political agenda, just like the Pulse shooter.

&gt;Where do we draw the line between ""disturbed mental patient"" and ""terrorist""?

The line is exactly where it always has been - if they are using fear to push an agenda, they are a terrorist.

&gt;Roof later confessed that he committed the shooting in hopes of igniting a race war.

That means he's technically a terrorist, too, since he is trying to push an anti-black agenda.

However, I feel that as of late the usage of the word 'terrorist' has grown to imply association with a terrorist group. If the Charleston shooter were a member of the KKK, and the KKK regularly committed acts of terror (they don't actually do that nowadays AFAIK, but it's the closest thing I can come up with), then the media would call him a terrorist too.

Calling what the Pulse shooter did 'Islamic terrorism' is as accurate as calling the Charleston shooter 'racist terrorism'. The only reason the Charleston shooter isn't labeled a terrorist is because there is no racist anti-black terrorist group with an agenda that he could have claimed to have been pushing.

Basically, you're seeing racism where there isn't any. If you can find a group of white people with a codified agenda who are committing violence in the name of that agenda, and yet not being called terrorists, then I will grant you that there is hypocrisy.

Also what's stopping these things from being provided by the free market? I can go out and buy food, water, shelter, and internet easily. Why would I need the government to provide these things when all they'll do is move money around in the form of taxation?

I'm also concerned with the cost. A system like this would be unsustainable in the long run. It would just add more money to the national debt and the government doesn't have a good record of allocating money efficiently compared to a business because wasted money isn't as much of a concern to a government.

How would the government provided internet work? Will it be a government contact with a private company or a government run internet company? I could see some problems with censorship if the government actually runs the internet.

The problem with assigning rights like that is, who provides them? If I say you have the right to freedom of speech, or your liberty, that does not require the government to give you anything at the expense of another.

But shelter, food, water, medical care, those are products and services that require constant action and effort from others to produce / provide. 

If I say you have a right to them, does that mean you can force those professionals to provide you with their products and services for no charge? 

The other way to do it, as is normally done in welfare systems, is through collective taxation. But that's still money being spent on you from people who were unwilling to give it to you to begin with.

I'm no fan of iPhones but everything about them is out in the open. Sure, Apple tries to paint them in the best possible light, but this is something all companies do with their own products. 

I also do not agree on their products being 'overpriced', at least not for all their products. They fill a niche market, but they fill it very well and for a very reasonable price. Take the 12"" macbook for example. Sure, you can get more processing power, memory and storage for less money but those aren't the selling points of the laptop. Portability is (and yes, aesthetics are as well). I seriously doubt you could find another laptop that has:

- A total weight of 920 grams
- A thickness of 13mm 
- A 1440p 16:10 screen
- 256GB of storage and 8GB ram
- A completely fanless design

For $1,299 or less. Then there are the obvious advantages of being able to simultaneously run (for instance) a fully functional MS Office suite next to a bash terminal. Like it or not, those things are important to some people. Sure, it has a 1.1GHz processor that's on par with a 2007-era Core2Duo but Apple doesn't sell processing power when it sells a 12"" Macbook. Portability and aesthetics may not be what you want to buy when shopping for a laptop, but it is for other people.

If you were able to get the same for less from a different company, then it would in my opinion be fair to call it overpriced, but I'm pretty sure you can't.

http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-laz-iphonecost-20140917-story.html

If we assume the iPhone X costs around $400 to make, and sells for $1000, that is not as huge of a margin as you might think.  Also if you compare it to something like household furniture which is often marked up 200-400%, its not that bad.

Some of these calculations of the real cost of the phone also don't include labor and other costs, and instead just add up the cost of the individual components inside the phone.

Other costs include the marketing and creating the ""brand"" you mentioned in the CMV.  Also Apple has a history of in-house R&amp;D and making its own components, the new Apple A11 is just the newest example of this.  

Finally, its also a pretty objective fact that Apple knows what it's doing.  If you look at the history, and how it was quite recently the most valuable corporation in the world. The new iPhone might launch it back up there again.

You also have to ask yourself what are the other companies doing? Oh yeah Samsung phones burst into flames sometimes.  The head of Samsung is likely going to spend sometime in jail, convicted on corruption charges, their company is constantly involved with scandals.

I never owned a Mac myself and working for the first time with it feels super annoying. But that's not really something that you can hold against an OS. 

The amount of tools isn't really a factor either as long as you have the right tools available. Do you have examples of tools that are missing on OSX? I never heard any of our developers who are using a Mac say: ""Sorry, I cannot do that, there is no tool that can do that.""

Greater customization also isn't a relevant factor for me, I am also not even sure what you mean by greater customization and how it is supposed to help me as a developer.

For the support: while I agree that there is a big community (though I cannot imagine that you won't find any help for Windows or OSX problems), most development problems are OS independent.

People don't understand how many hard problems Apple has solved in computer vision with its AR software because most see it as nothing more than a small feature in a list, but AR is more than a feature, it's the platform for the future and incredibly difficult to pull off given the current state of technology. True, Google release ARCore around the same time and other companies like Nvidia and Qualcomm are making big strides in computer vision, but a lot of what Apple did was in house and to a higher standard, and naturally those R&amp;D costs are passed down to consumers in the cost of the phones. Just seeing what Apple is able to do by levying computer vision on its camera software is spellbinding.

The phones themselves, on a hardware level, may be valued at $2-300 but when you account for everything else that went into it... I think $1000 or so is reasonable. If you don't see the value or potential in these new features, you really don't need to have the latest model iPhone as any phone from the last three years should suffice.

And part of that is because Apple maintains full control over their hardware and software. Not all android phones work as well as one another.

But my 4 year old iPad runs just as well as my wife's 1 year old iPad mini and I haven't found an android tablet manufacturer that has come close to that kind of consistency.

t3_5jfqhp,"A soldier perpetuates war. So in a world without soldiers there would be no war?

What would make you think this?

On a different but similar level: Police.

The police force enforce an aspect of the will of the government, which stands behind the laws we've made. Police make communities safer from obvious crime with their presence or by taking action against criminals. So that is their purpose. To enforce and protect the law.

The army has a similar but different function. Armies defend nations, and also carry out the will of their government, defending the resources the country relies on or securing border lines, passage routes, everything that enables stable development.

MY POINT: Without an army, the government will still need to TAKE ACTION to ensure the citizens/communities are safe and provided for. If there was no army, this would fall on to the police forces in the communities, because people/companies/governments still want stuff. Essentially, you would still need an army to function as a country, or form alliances with someone who has one. Trade is the ONLY other way we can overcome this, by increasing access to resources for everyone and reducing the effectiveness of an army over time. The army was necessary to ensure the resources were secure initially but trade can overcome it.

Can the blame really be put on a soldier for this? The need is created by the system we have in place. The need will be there until it's no longer needed. Unless you're willing to argue that it is in the best interest for poor people to want to die or suffer rather than join the army?

I read your opening post, but could not find any argument that are relevant to the CMV prompt. Reading your responses to others, it seems to me that your argument against the deterrent argument is that the opposing force would also have no army. That's doesn't make sense. 

The reality is that other nations have military forces. Not having a military force puts your country at risk of being exploited. Regardless of your choices, or the choices of people in your nation, it will not change the fact that peoples from other nations have militaries and will continue to maintain them. Historically, wars of unification are sought with a justification to end all wars by putting everyone under one banner. That is a situation where one power exerts overwhelming power to enforce peace. You hope for another way. The premise of that way must be one where your nation can still get the results of having a deterrent force without actually having one, while allowing the rights of other nation states to maintain forces of their own.

If you can solve that,  and you'll deserve the nobel peace prize. Without that, soldiers serving their nation are not perpetuating war. On the contrary, they are perpetuating peace.

War can still be fought without soldiers, ships, planes or guns. 

Everyone needs food, water, shelter and other resources to live their lives. When you run out of natural resources in your home, you natural go outside of your home to obtain natural resources. The same thing happens when your country runs out of natural resources. 

But all of that can be prevented with trade right? Yes it can, however many wars have started when country's don't recognize other countries  money. Money is just printed from nothing, so it's easy to dismiss the value of a foreign countries. You can have politicians decide to not trade with foreign countries for any excuse imaginable. Anything from a prince stealing a king's wife to accusing another country of owning weapons of mass destruction. 

So militaries are necessary to invade foreign countries for natural resources and also to defend from the invasion of foreign people from stealing your countries natural resources. 

So it's better to have a military that can serve it's citizens to take and to defend. Bottom line, it's necessary to have the ability to control money and natural resources.

t3_5jfqhp,"Seeing the time stamps on a lot of these, I'm probably too late. But here goes!

Your view is one of many in a greater debate about the fundamental nature of mankind: If civilization were removed - with its national pride and drive for resources taken with it - would mankind be peaceful, or violent? 

Unfortunately, the question itself is moot; whether or not mankind as a whole were peaceful is irrelevant because there only needs to be violent individuals, few and far between, to trigger cycles of violence. These violent individuals will have to be met with violence in order to insure the survival of the whole. One this has happened, it is no longer just these individuals who must be considered violent; it is the home. TL;DR: Humans are violent.

So, if country A does not have a military, only police, and country B *does* have a military, country B *will* exploit the situation. History shows this happens time and time again. Until a global order is established, countries will compete for resources. This competition sometimes delves into violence, because that is a fundamental aspect of our species. Hopefully, we will eventually evolve out of it. In the meantime, we have not, and war is guaranteed to exist somewhere in the world.  

Following this model, volunteering to serve doesn't make you a perpetrator of war - only a participant in something that would be happening whether you were there or not. Global peace will be a consequence of a shift in philosophy and emotional maturity by the entire species over time, not the actions or inactions of a single person.

t3_6rwcio,"Hello 39nectarines, I'm an autistic person. :)

I have a couple of thoughts about your view. 

The first is that while you're not advocating for me or people like me to be killed, you are advocating that myself and people like should never have been born to begin with. Which, for future generations of people like me, kind of amounts to the same thing; non-existence. I'm wondering what gives you, or anyone else for that matter, the moral authority to say whether or not I should exist?

Your argument seems to be that we're a burden on society, without redeeming value to justify that burden. To this I would urge you to explore the many, varied, and wonderful contributions disabled people have made to society. Much like you, many of us are a part of a community of friends, family, &amp; neighbors, and participate in a mutual enriching of one another's lives. Like some abled people, some disabled people even make broader contributions to society, often by applying their own unique perspective. 

Perhaps you're thinking that I fall above your threshold for ""severe,"" in which case: who gets to decide where that threshold is, and how? At what point do someone's contributions become irrelevant, and do you think science will be able to accurately predict which disabled people have the potential to be good friend/family/neighbors/members of society and which will fall below this hypothetical threshold? 

I would highly recommend this article to you, which is quite long, but covers a lot of important ground, especially with respect to the historical context of the idea that disabled people are a burden on society. http://autisticadvocacy.org/2017/02/autism-and-the-disability-community-the-politics-of-neurodiversity-causation-and-cure/",dl8g0zr,CMV Knowingly Having (Mentally) Retarded Children is Morally Wrong,29,Fairness and equality,1,30,2022-05-01T19:03:18.410776Z,2022-05-01T19:03:18.410776Z,70.307

Intellectual and cognitive disability is not a discrete issue, there is a spectrum of intelligence, and whilst some genetic diseases like Down syndrome are quite clearly associated with intellectual disability, we really have little way of knowing to what extent these individuals will suffer from learning problem until after birth as they begin to grow and develop. Down babies can and do have normal or subnormal IQs. Moreover there are an innumerable number of other factors that contribute to intellectual disability, which even today cannot be predicted to any degree before birth.

Your conclusion would seem to suggest that we should abort all those suspected of having such a disability, which no doubt would include many many otherwise healthy babies.

For me it would do society a great disservice to not allow people with severe mental illnesses live.,dl8zx25,CMV Knowingly Having (Mentally) Retarded Children is Morally Wrong,9,Other,1,10,2022-05-01T17:47:55.141007Z,2022-05-01T17:47:55.141007Z,211.16
t3_6rwcio,"You're essentially talking about practicing eugenics here, which is treacherous ground to tread. In theory, the idea of aborting certain types of fetuses or sterilizing the people that knowingly display risk factors for producing such a fetus sounds great and would greatly diminish the prevalence of disabilities, mental handicaps, genetic illnesses, and so on. But in practice, eugenics has always been a failed science. 


The US experimented with eugenics in mental hospitals before WWII. We sterilized schizophrenic patients in an attempt to curb the overwhelming numbers of new schizophrenia cases. Germany of course dabbled with racial (and medical) eugenics during the war. The question of consent was a non starter in both cases; schizophrenics technically could not give consent to be sterilized because of their mental capacity (and because of being under the influence of heavy medication), and of course no one in Germany gave consent to anything, but sterilizations (and deaths in Germany's case) were carried out regardless ""for the good of the people"". **neither scenario played out well in the end


In the case of aborting fetuses that show abnormalities, were arguing free will. Should a person carrying a fetus with downs be allowed to practice free will and decide to keep it or abort on their own, or should someone step in and take away that free will to mandate an abortion? 


In a moral sense, there really is no argument because everyone's moral compass is different and based off of individual experiences culminated over a lifetime. Some people morally oppose abortion; how would that be handled? Some people morally oppose even having sonograms or genetic testing done on (unborn) children, what then since they didn't know ahead of time?

t3_6rwcio,"If you use a purely capitalist view of persons having value, euthanasia of severely developmentally disabled persons makes sense.

If you acknowledge the reality that all work, whether paid or unpaid, significantly adds value to households, organizations, and societies, then it's plain that many of the developmentally disabled persons (such as those with Downs) add far more value than they cost.

When it comes to extremely developmentally disabled infants with conditions recognized as ""incompatible with life"" (such as those with Edwards or anencephaly), I would generally remain with your original stance of euthanasia.",dl92oit,CMV Knowingly Having (Mentally) Retarded Children is Morally Wrong,7,Capacity and resources,1,8,2022-05-01T17:42:52.067373Z,2022-05-01T17:42:52.067373Z,147.623
t3_6rwcio,"Are you talking about people carrying the gene who know for a fact that they will be having mentally retarded children? And that they should restrain from reproducing?  Because most of the time people only find out during the pregnancy that something is wrong(after the tests) so aborting the child just because it has down syndrome isn't fair...

t3_6rwcio,"To extend your argument further, there are many diseases that drain are taxes. Many diseases that children will be born with or have shortly after birth. Diabetes 1, heart defects, etc. are you also saying that because these too will drain the system and may cause these ones to not be very productive citizens we may perhaps choose to abort them. Where does it stop. Who chooses who is acceptable to live. Who chooses who is worth the cost. Put yourself on the scale and you were born with an illness. Would you want someone to access your cost on society. Calculate whether or not you may be productive in those circumstances, and decide if you were an acceptable risk? It could get to the point that the government would not want to pay or allow anybody on Medicare to have a baby with any congenital birth defects or foreseeable medical problems. 

Is that the type of world we live in? The closest we have to that is China. There restrictions on babies. It has caused harm. But that is nothing close to what you are suggesting. But you know that.

t3_6rwcio,"This world does not run on ""efficiency"" alone. You could even argue that applying value or utility to any human life is immoral. Assuming too that science should run our lives and having the best possible human specimens is subjective. Some may argue that compassion and love have done more for the human kind than what you've mentioned. 

The largest problem here is that there's is an assumption on the value of a person's life. Ones a certain amount of money mean more than an individual. What about those who choose not to work, but depend on tax money? What about prisoners who cost tax payers 30,000 a year to imprison? Should we all haul them into a ditch and bury it? That would be truly immoral.

t3_6rwcio,"While I agree with you to a large extent, there is a spectrum to retardation.   Certainly there are children born who except for the fact they look like a human, they are so severely mentally retarded, their life is nothing like ours.
